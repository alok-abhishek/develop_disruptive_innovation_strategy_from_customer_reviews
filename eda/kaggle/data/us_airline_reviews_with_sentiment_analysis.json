The crew with the exception of the male steward neither looked welcoming not hospitable. They seemed to be going through the motions and there was no warmth in their demeanour.. I traveled with family from Bangalore to Mopa airport in Goa On 6th Jul. There was another problem with this airline. They accepted bookings for a flight that they didn't operate. They choose to put me on an earlier flight QP1392 instead of QP1398. I incurred an additional charge for the return flight with another airline since they informed on their only 2 weeks ahead of departure. Highly unethical for them to accept bookings in such manner. The 4 in my rating is more for the equipment and airfare. Neither their website nor helpline nor ground staff pass the muster.",

The crew seems to be more interested in making money than to assist. Unreasonably expensive seat cost. I had to pay 20000 INR as it was urgent. While doing web check in there was no option to auto seat select and was forced to book exit bay seats with paying additional 1400 INR and this felt like a scam, why because there were passengers at last moment that were sitting in some other seats and were allowed to sit in the seats for which I paid extra. Also at last moment some passengers were asked to sit in the seats that I paid extra for and it doesn't seems like that's their seat as no seat number verification was done. ",

I approached smiling customer service representatives who took my two pieces of luggage (I had prepaid for 15 kg extra luggage because I was flying internationally,) They weighed them , handed me my boarding pass and said have a nice flight. I have never experienced such an easy check in. Boarding was seamless. They boarded back of the plane first.  Plane was full, but didn't take long to board. The plane was impeccably spotless and spacious.  Would definitely fly with them again. It took literally one hour from my house, to the airport, thru check in and security, and to the terminal!",

Akasa being an LCC has the best fares including their flexi fares which I found the best thing about flying with them comparison to other Low cost airlines. I had pre booked a meal which was a special \"Holi Festive Meal\" it tasted good and was fresh. A choice of complimentary beverage was also included in the fare which was nice. Also another great thing was the free water bottle which is nothing but a dream onboard many other LCCs like Air Asia where they charge even for a bottle of water so I do appreciate Akasa Air for this. Also the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft was very comfortable with wider windows and great interior mood lighting. Overall a great flight which despite taking off late arrived before time and I would love to fly Akasa again!",

To start with the flight was late to start from Mumbai and thus arrived late in Bangalore. We had 5 hours transit time in Bangalore , so we were hanging out in the airport lounge. But they preponed the flight from Bangalore without any prior information. Obviously we didn't knew about this and missed the flight. Later when we spoke with manager and other staffs of the airlines, they handled the situation quite unprofessionaly and Irresponsibly. As we were transit passengers no airlines can take of the flight without transit passengers. They didn't make any effort at all to get in touch with us initially to inform about the change in the timing and later for boarding the flight. Anyways even after talking with then for a total of two hours they didn't provide us with any suitable alternative options.  We had to book hotel and take a later flight on the same day after 12 hours. The money for hotels, transport and food was just a waste from our side to clearly a mistake from their side. I am writing this review sitting in the above said Bangalore to kochi flight and it's delayed. ",

Flight was on time, no hassle there. The staff were really good. The aircraft, a Boeing 747 was really clean and the inside of it was really colorful and pleasant to look at. The seats were also comfortable with ample leg space for a tall guy like me. The cabin crew members were also very helpful and didn't make a fuss about anything. So overall, the whole experience was positive and made me a happy and a satisfied person.

Air hostess was very rude when I asked her to help with my luggage. She said that \"we are not here to pick up luggage of people\". Working with the service industry and answering in this manner to your customer is just not acceptable.",

        "Review": " Never be flying with 'Akasa Air' again I am a frequent traveller and the experience below is my worse airline experience so far! We booked 2 tickets (different PNR), one was on my name - Ashima Arora and the other was on my husbands name - Nishan Singh. My infant ticket was attached to my husbands PNR. My husband couldn't travel because of some personal reasons. We (Myself and My infant) reached the Akasa Air counter on time (10am it was and the flight was at 11am), my boarding pass was also printed but when the staff realized that my infant was added in a different PNR, he asked me to wait and tried calling the supervisor/manager to check what needs to be done in this case. I was standing there for 30 minutes and constantly reminding the staff about the moving clock. However, he assured me that I need not worry as they'll have me onboard. After 30 minutes at 10:30am, the staff told me that I need to pay Rs1500 to move my child's name in my PNR number from my husbands PNR. I tried to find out the real reason behind the charges as there are airlines that do not charge for it if it has to be from one parent to another parent. It was 10:32am. I took 1 minute to absorb those charges and told the counter staff that I'll pay as I want to board that flight. It was 10:33am. He called someone again (I believe it was a supervisor standing on the boarding gate) in front of me that the passenger was ready to pay now, but the person on the other side refused to take the payment and have us board the flight. So, the staff took 30 minutes to inform me about the next step but did not spare even 3 minutes of time to let me absorb those extra charges I had to pay (for PNR move). We were left there and couldn't board that flight. I waited for the supervisor/manager for another 1 hour and 30 minutes but no one showed up even the staff informed them that the passenger was waiting. I was left with no other choice and I reached out to the airport authority with the concern. When the staff of airport authority accompanied me, only then the supervisor showed up. He started giving some lame excuses that I was already late for the flight at 10:30am and I reached late to the airport. Since they have very less number of flights operational and haven't even tied up with any other airline, they could only place me in the next day flight. And now, I had to pay Rs1500 for moving the infant's name and Rs2000 extra to secure my seat for the next day. And these charges were for one-side travel. Similarly, for the way back from Kochi to BNG I again paid Rs1500 for the infant. I actually had to pay double i.e. Rs6000 which is higher than my ticket's original price for my infant. And additionally Rs2000 more for my ticket too. Spent around 14 hours in the airport with my infant. Lost a day of hotel booking charges too since we were flying for holidays and the holiday package was already booked. When I wrote this concern to their customer support, initially I started getting response with as if I have connected to the wrong team with the concern. After writing to then a number of times, I got a response saying that all fault was of us as passengers and thus, they can't help in any which means without letting me know their source of collecting the facts or the information. The resistance was very clear in the emails I received from the customer care too.",

Akasa gave 1 hour time before the departure, as its boarding time, which is atrocious. Today, I was on the way to the airport, when I received a last moment notification stating the delay of my flight QP 1314 by an hour, which was still okay at that point. The madness began when I reached the airport and was lined in the queue for checking in my luggage when the Akasa employees started pulling out other passengers from another flight that had begun boarding. On finally reaching the counters after over half an hour, the ground staff refused to take my luggage as the Departure time was 3.30 pm after the delay, and the \"boarding\" mentioned by them was 2.30 pm and the time was 2.32 pm. They refused the baggage, and I had to run through security with 15kg of luggage, which had 2 bottles of alcohol. Upon finally reaching the gate, the flight was mentioned delayed again. The boarding did not start before 3.20 pm. ",

Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said \"Yes\" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.",

There are no TV\u2019s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you can\u2019t walk to the bathroom because there\u2019s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they don\u2019t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! We\u2019re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesn\u2019t recline. I\u2019m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldn\u2019t you tell us that during boarding?",

They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines. I did file a complaint directly with their company, but after seeing the way they Alaskan's employees represent this airline, I will be looking at taking my business to their competitors in the future.

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was \"all up in the air\". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink.

On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles.

When I was finally able to reach an Alaska Airlines representative by phone and explain the situation, I learned that there was no unaccompanied minor status applied to our child when the reservation was made by phone, contrary to what my husband was told by the airline representative at the time of purchase. I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn\u2019t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor\u2019s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t charge you!\u201d I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative\u2019s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate. If I had not directly asked the representative what was required when I was denied a gate pass, I never we would have even heard about the \u201cyellow form \u201c. Alaska Airlines is worse than the Keystone cops and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.",

I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow. Horrible customer service, very petty because we booked through Air to Sea, treated us terrible like we had done something wrong, not to mention plenty of seating they are refusing to sell us.

When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasn't entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further. Having flown Hawaiian Airlines to many islands in Hawaii and enjoying the warm and genuine friendly and cheerful staff on Hawaiian it was a stark contrast traveling with Alaska Airlines for the first time. Whereas the flight attendants on Hawaiian greet every passenger when boarding my wife and I noticed that he Flight Attendants on Alsaka were too busy talking to each other when we boarded to even greet us! Service on board was also very indifferent and you got the feeling they were just going through the motions until the aircraft got to its destination.

They booked our flights to Kona the next day, booked a night at the Comfort Inn and gave us food vouchers with no cost to us.

When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day. Flights are also super limited with awful flight times for non stops, and ridiculous layovers for multi-stop trips. On board wifi is trash and not worth the $8 they Want out of you.

Got onboard, asked for help putting my little case above me. No, they\u2019re not \u201callowed\u201d to handle baggage. Man, do I miss Virgin. Worst decision to let Alaska take them over. Worst service in the industry.",

However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there\u2019s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don\u2019t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasn\u2019t bumping into me. And if that doesn\u2019t prove that these terrible flight attendants have no respect or self awareness then I don\u2019t know what does. All of these flight attendants need some more training on being professional and being considerate of others.",

Pros 1) Flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading, so if you've arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through TSA and boarding pass first, you should reasonably make it. 2) Flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3) Tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot. Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped. I'm skinny, and anyone who's taken care of his/her body should be able to use them without difficulty.",

        "Review": " Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn\u2019t fly there). I\u2019ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I\u2019m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don\u2019t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can\u2019t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I\u2019ve never been offended. I\u2019ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to \u201dtell on me\u201d. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It\u2019s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don\u2019t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the \u201crude\u201d passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",

We get to Seattle to find out the snowboard bag didn\u2019t even make it on the flight. We lost hundreds of dollars not having our equipment for this trip. Our return flight on Christmas Day was canceled due to \u201cmechanical issues\u201d and we were told they couldn\u2019t get us out until the 28th. My husband had to let them know he\u2019s military and has to be back on the 27th in order for them help us. So we rebooked for today (the 26th) with three layovers. We are missing all of our connecting flights because the flight attendant was over an hour late for our first flight out of Seattle. We then had to de-plane because of an electrical issue. We\u2019re currently being told at the podium that there\u2019s nothing they can do for us. This is worse than the time I got trapped in France because a different airline went bankrupt right before my flight. Alaska is worse than Delta, Spirit, United, etc.",

        "Review": " Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, \"well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew\". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she \"must be strapped into her own seat\". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says \"nope, strap her in\". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says \"somebody's first flight eh\". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead. I get that expenses are up, but don't lower your standards or service too. Alaska used to be a top two airline for me, but never again. Alaska 1048 from San Diego to Boston.",

The row I was put on was with another flight attendants (I wish I knew her name) boyfriend and he talked to me for three hours while she and other attendants came by to periodically check up on me. They gave me a fuzzy heat pad and water and so much compassion. I can\u2019t even begin to express the amount of gratitude I felt towards these people. I normally fly with my husband or family but circumstances had me take the flight on my own and I really wanted to meet my new born niece. I highly recommend this airline..

There were plenty choices of food on offer, including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate, we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable. Left on time and service was great, including the protein plate. We were able to see the larger peaks, such as Shasta, Hood, and Reiner. Landing at Everett was interested with all the Boeing wide bodies waiting to be painted.

        "Review": "  We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska\u2019s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered \u201ctheir fault\u201d, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn\u2019t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn\u2019t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska\u2019s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that \u201cif we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation\u201d. To which I replied \u201cyou should\u201d. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said \u201cwhat weather?\u201d Again in hadn\u2019t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn\u2019t snowing. She yelled at me and stated \u201cGive me back your tickets\u201d. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated \u201cno\u201d you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn\u2019t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn\u2019t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that \u201cYou will be losing a customer, not that you care\u201d. And she said extremely snarky \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we will\u201d. I said \u201cExcuse me, you don\u2019t think you will what?\u201d She reiterated, \u201cI don\u2019t think we will be losing a customer\u201d. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name. As I was leaving she yelled that she would be \u201cnotating my account\u201d, again threatening me as much as she could.",

I don\u2019t know what is going on but they are no longer reliable in terms of booking a flight or picking a seat. Count yourself lucky if you get on a flight. I may be looking into Capital One travel card that allows you to book with any airline and the airline treats you as a full paying customer - not treated poorly for being a loyal customer.",

        "Review": "  Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help if you request mobility assistance. In Boston - I requested assistance, they refused to help me to the counter. My luggage was falling, I was tripping. But I got no help! Then I was told I had to put my checked luggage on the platform. I said I needed help I was told \"you have to put your luggage up here\". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said \"Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help\" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport. I arrived in Seattle, jumped in their wheelchair and barely made it to the connection. Arrived in Anchorage - there was a rep on the ramp talking on the radio stating he had already requested wheelchairs that were not there. So I didn't bother to hang around. I walked all over the airport and I am in serious pain, I will never depend on Alaska Airlines to help anyone disabled. It works against us and we have to tip everyone so it costs more. Stewards and stewardesses range from incompetent to excellent.",

We flew from Alaska to Dallas related to a relocation so our cats had to fly for their first time for such a long journey across the lower 48. They flew in carriers under the plane scary for us! Alaska airlines called our pets by their names and Places boarding pass stickers on their crates with our names and a row of sticker ticket with their names and our names. One would be removed from the carrier before each take off and handed to me letting us know that they are indeed on our plane. Each time we landed a ground crew member would greet us and tell us they saw our cats personally and they have arrived and doing well they once again called them by name and always with a smile. Every Alaska airlines staff I saw regarding our cats seemed to be so protective of them . I could not ask for a better experience in such a scary situation.

When we went online to check in, 2 tickers were gone. I immediately called the number back and was informed that they had been canceled on our end. After much arguing back and forth I hung up. My wife and friend had no tickets and we were to fly out the next day. I went back to Google and found a different number to a nice lady in Boise. She informed me that we had been scammed. I asked to have it reversed and she stated, \"there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund.\" I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up. Having no options, we did just that. Once we got the new tickets we realized they were for our exact original seats. I have a hard time believing that a large company whose job is to service customers and knows that scams such as this doesn't have some protocol for just a situation. I highly recommend finding another flight service. Alaska Airlines I feel has no concern for their customers. Absolute garbage service or protection.",

They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I\u2019m annoyed at this point but recognize it\u2019s almost over I\u2019ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times.

From customer service to the ticket agent to the flight attendants, I could not be more pleased. They boarded the plane first with the flight crew and departed the plane last with the flight crew. We were allowed to escort them to their gate and sit with them until they boarded the plane and were in the air. They checked their aunts ID upon arrival and ours when they returned. I felt they were safe and as a parent, I needed to know they were safe. The kids had a blast and the flight attendants said they were well behaved and polite. We even googled their flight number and knew exactly where they were at all times. One if the kids was texting us from 35,000 feet. They had a snack on board and watched movies during their flight. Awesome job Alaskan. We will use this airline again. Thank you for making this parent feel their children were in the best of hands and thank you for looking out for my kids.",

        "Review": "  I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our \"wagon\" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to \"solve\" the problem threatened us by saying \"do you want to fly today?\". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport. I will avoid using Alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress.",

        "Review": "  I recently had two very enjoyable flights with Alaska in early July. I had never used Alaska before but after a recommendation from a friend, decided to give them a go. I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US. I should use United my default Star Alliance option, but with this pricing and service I am quite happy to use Alaska in future.",

My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska? You messed up hardcore with the flight being reschedule and losing their luggage and all that was compensated was a $50 voucher with the worst customer service? Yeah, we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest, they've never done me dirty. I'd give Alaska a zero rating if I could.",

When I attempted to use the first class restroom, I was met with resistance by the stewardesses in that the stewardesses would not allow me to use the restroom. The flight attendant stood in front of me and stated \u201c the bathroom is in the back.\u201d I explained to both how I have a bladder issue and I am in need to use the bathroom. They both stated I am not in first class and that I need to go use the bathroom in the back. I explained that there is a long time and I was unable to wait due to my pain.

They are supposed to give us 3 meals in our 16 hour flight where as they just gave us 2 meals and they skipped the other meal by giving us an ice cream only. I'll not recommend this airline at all. If they can't give proper service, they should shut it down.",

        "Review": "  Los Angeles to Dallas Fort-Worth onboard AA2833 on their A321-200. My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants were friendly, courteous, and attentive, although they could've been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and re-ensure that everyone is doing okay. once the service is complete. The Biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty. The real positive thing about this flight was the Wi-Fi. It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes. Overall, my experience and first impression onboard American Airlines was somewhat impressive. Also, if you're asking for help, contact them via Twitter or use the Live Chat feature. They can sometimes be faster than the phone team.",

As they did not give me options I had to figure this out myself then they completely lost my bag. It has been all over the US. I get different stories from every person I speak to. I\u2019ve spoken to seven different people and they\u2019ve all giving me different stories. When I reached out to American, they offered me a $25 flight credit. It was almost insulting after everything I had been through with this airline and all the hoops I had to jump through and they lost my bag to offer me $25 flight credit thinking I would ever fly with them again is horrible. I highly recommend even if it another airline is more expensive. It is way worth it. It is not worth going through what I went through and nobody that works for them will care.",

        "Review": "  This was in regards to attempting business travel and not finding resolution in the online available connections offered. I decided to determine what flights were actually available from RDU through Charlotte onto final destination of STL. Finding the options I needed, I called \"customer service\" to ask if they could simply join the individual segments I found since it wasn't being offered as connecting flights on AA.com. The CSR said it's called a \"Merit\" itinerary (or something like that) and quoted a price about 50% higher than those offered online. The csr had a poor attitude, very terse in his interaction with me and ultimately did not care about my satisfaction. But, I believe it's a larger problem at American Airlines. If I need to travel to a final destination and must connect through another city and flights are published on AA.com in individual segments and are available, why can't American Airlines accommodate the customer and simply book the individual flights at no additional cost to a loyal customer? I've noticed this being true with Award Travel - whoever is in charge of managing the connecting schedules for those customers who need to travel with connections, is not at all customer-focused and needs to attend a few seminars on how to continue to satisfy the customer.

They managed to get us on another flight, but then we sat in the plain without moving for 2 hours. Apparently, they didn\u2019t know how to weigh the plane. At least, that\u2019s the excuse they gave when they started making the flight attendants count the passengers, and that was after an hour and half of sitting there with no news. Because of that delay, we missed our connecting flight to Japan. We waiting over 2 hours in line for help and would have waiting longer had I not flagged down a random employee and begged for help. They were able to put us on a different route, adding over 12 hours to our trip. To top it off, they lost our baggage. Our baggage sat in the USA for 3 days before they found it and sent it to us.

From LAX to PHX the flight went as planned but once in PHX they said we missed connecting flight. We did not miss any flight through fault of our own. The previous day that sent an email that ask to change flights and be compensated. I refused as I had a planned schedule. Since I refused to delay voluntarily I think they just booted me to the later flight. In PHX we were switched to three different gates and two different flights. Our plan included an 5 hour drive from our destination airport, ABQ , to Amarillo which was close to home. We had left our vehicle in ABQ and were suppose to pick it up around 7 PM for our drive home. We ended up in ABQ at almost midnight and we were dead tired so decided to not make the drive and just spend the night. I am currently seeking compensation for the room and expensive meals we had to eat at the airport. I doubt that I will ever choose AA again. I was also not happy with the airplane A320 and the way they seated passengers. We were four, two adults and two teens, The adults were seated 5 rows back from the teens which might not have been so bad if the plane were full but there were empty rows, not seats, rows behind our teens. We also noted three grown men had to share a row when there were plenty of empty seats that they should have been seated in for better comfort.",

On 7/16, my husband and I were returning from a very much needed vacation from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting flight from MIA to Boston. Upon the flight being delayed 4 times they eventually cancelled the flight all together leaving us confused because this is the first time we've experienced this issue. Lady at the desk told us to rebook at gate 14 so my husband and everyone else went to gate 14 only to find out we were in the wrong place. After waiting 3 hours in line we found out there would be no more flights from MIA to Boston until 2 days later. Both my husband and I were expected to return to work the following day yet now we are stuck in FL for 2 additional days. I went to another gate that had just boarded near by, a flight going to Rio de Janeiro, to ask if they knew where we could find our luggage and to my shock the 2 women behind the desk were talking trash about the people waiting in the now 5 hour line to rebook cancelled flights. I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are \"stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them\" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts. Upset I approached the woman behind the desk and let her know that I was one of the people standing in line and looked at me wide eyed as the other employee walked away I asked her if she could do something besides speaking on people she doesn't know and tell me where I can locate my luggage. She told me I would have to go elsewhere to baggage customer service and ask them and told me to please be patient and I replied just like I was now when she felt the need to make fun of people she doesn't know. I walked away and my husband and I went downstairs to find the baggage customer service and after waiting in line yet again for an hour, another employee walked over to tell everyone in line that we are wasting our time. He announced that all the baggage from the canceled flights were in back and no one is going through them because it's too many luggage to go through. Everyone in line became very upset, some yelling at the employee asking what he meant. One man lost his mind telling the baggage guy that the people from upstairs sent him down here for his bags and the baggage guy told him that they only do ticketing and we do baggage and said they don't know what their talking about and no one from the canceled flights would be getting their bags. Angry I went up to the desk to ask if there was anyway possible to retrieve our luggage, we will now be in FL for 2 days without clothes and bags. Also 5mths pregnant, all of my clothes and other things were in my luggage. The lady at the desk told us she had no idea where our luggage is but she would put some note into the system so me and my husband would be able to pick up our luggage at the customer service desk in the morning. Upon searching for hotels for the night as I am pregnant and refused to sleep in the airport and of course everywhere near the airport was booked up. We found a hotel by luck and got there after 5am the next morning 3 more hours later after using Uber to get around town looking for available rooms. Next morning we went back to baggage only to find out the girls note was overridden and our bags were now in Boston so we had no luggage. How are we to be compensated for all the time and money lost dealing with the AA employees?",

The hotel that took me is another story. Desperate times call for desperate measures. My travel agent ended up booking my flights 2 days later, no thanks to American Airlines.

It was like going back to 2011, 2012 with American! Not only was the plane my partner and I flew this time around; both on the flight to and from, old and decrepit (relatively clean, but extremely dated), there was hardly any legroom whatsoever.  This journey was made even more miserable because one of the flight attendants in the back of the plane was rude and dismissive when I had to get up and use the restroom. She told me to \"sit down because of turbulence\". There was no turbulence at that point. It got to the point where I waved up to another flight attendant at the front of the plane if I could use the restroom up there and he was very friendly and understanding and said I could \"but to make it quick before the turbulence\" and sure enough I was able to do so (it was also an emergency). He was so nice, and I was able to sit back down before the turbulence (which got pretty bad at one point), but the other female flight crew member denying me access to the restroom when there was not any turbulence at one point was rude and unprofessional.

We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to \u201cbook our own hotels\u201d and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, we\u2019re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money. Absolutely the worst experience ever. I am so disappointed in American Airlines and would recommend that people fly with literally ANY other airline.",

        "Review": " American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think \"OK, not bad at all\" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me \"You can certainly book a flight with United\" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole \"it's about the journey, not the destination\" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies. Simply put, I almost missed a friend's wedding because of the American Airlines headache.",

I couldn't get a flight change on the phone, luckily I was near the end and got told that my flight was actually delayed? But it literally left when I arrived. Then was told that I was checked in, meaning someone was checked in with my seat before I arrived late. That I paid for. Odd. Finally I got another flight which was delayed by an hour. It took 5 hours to get me home. This was my first AA mishap, and it was trying to say the least.",

At no point did American Airlines try to get us all the way home. They left us stranded at the airport with no way home other than to rent a car and pay out of pocket to drive home. When I asked for a reimbursement, they absolutely refused. They claimed they can't reimburse people based on weather cancelations. I told them this wasn't about the weather cancelation, it was about them stranding us at an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination and not reimbursing us for having to get ourselves all of the way home.

        "Review": " First off, I paid for a first class ticket! A lot of money! I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didn\u2019t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn\u2019t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn\u2019t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would\u2019ve seen that I was first class. I didn\u2019t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn\u2019t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip. I don\u2019t appreciate being treated so badly. There was no cause for him to be this way, other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around. So American Airlines, you lost a customer.",

But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I\u2019m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I\u2019ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight. American wanted to wait on standby until the next day. I'm on a business trip for work there is no next business day. I'm just upset that it took so much time waiting to get no resolution and then me deciding to take my fate into my own hand where it got resolved. I will be calling American to get a travel credit after the amount they screwed me over. I\u2019ll better plan my trip next time but American get better and treat your customers right.

While in line we heard them give my husbands seat to a passenger in front of us, when scanning our boarding passes they didn\u2019t work, but our checked bags scanned? While in line for customer support (which was forever long) we were the next people in line and a worker pulled two groups to go to a gate worker to get the line down. We said no we wanted to stay, we were next in line. He told us we had to so another 2 hours later we are still in line at the gate and the gate worker had no clue what he was doing. So I went back and stood in line again at customer service. I made it to the front again before my husband moved so I called him to come back over. At the gate the worker would not look up where another customers bag was because they said over and over again that if you don\u2019t make it on a flight neither does your bag. So at customer service we were very nice in which we did not get in return. Asked us why we didn\u2019t know what flight we were on? Told us they rebooked us for 6 pm the next day. There were no hotels, no rental cars. So our only option was to stay at the airport for close to 20hrs. With no solution or compensation or anything. We then asked her if she could check where our bags were, in which she told us that if we didn\u2019t get on the flight neither did our bags. We asked again if she could just check. So she did and was very annoyed about it and sure enough, our bags were on the flight without us. We asked how that happened, then another customer service representative said we have no idea you\u2019re not talking to the right people about that? Who else would we talk to about that?

Agent gave us two standby passes and said we would not know if we can get on unless two people sis not show up or cancelled and we would not know until 10 pm until the after 10 pm. I asked 'what do we do if we do not get on this plane?' Well we were told we can apply to get a hotel room. Mind you I am 70 years old and dog tired from being at the Nashville Airport for leg one of our journey at 8am that morning, We could wait until after 10pm if we knew we had a seat but not just to be told we were denied. We had to see our daughter! I took an Uber to College Station and the Uber driver drove us over an extra 100 miles to charge us more, which was not the original route or price. I am dealing with that. I called American to see if we could get reimbursed and was told that the I should of gotten on the 10:00 pm flight as there Were 5 SEATS! The agent lied to us! I am very disappointed at American and their shoddy customer service.",

American Airlines is not even ready to deeply look into what went wrong in their system/process, and not ready to refund ($420 charged total for 4 checked in bags for 4 passengers).

She refused to make note of this and was not interested in a photo of my luggage. So\u2026.time passed, I called again as my luggage was still in Doha after several days. She still insisted that it was in Bangkok. Then my luggage traveled to JFK, Terminal 8 \u2014 right next to Dunkin Donuts but\u2026 she still insisted that it was in Bangkok. If she opened her eyes, it was likely right in her office. After several more days, it traveled to Newark and she still insisted it was in Bangkok. This morning it arrived at the Syracuse airport and eventually at my home by FedEx. But, no one ever notified me that my luggage was found and that it was being delivered. American Airlines systems are broken and their personnel are poorly trained. Last year, they refused to let 25+ people board the plane in Doha because we were about 10 minutes late arriving but the plane did not depart for over 2 hours causing all of these people to be rebooked. American Airline is part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Avoid flying with them whenever possible!",

So I proceeded to step to the side and continue my phone call with Carnival cruise line to let them know we are arriving late. Not even 3 minutes later my family is calling my name for us to board. As we were gathering our belongings and walking up to the boarding gate she yells to me and my family, y\u2019all moving pretty slow to be on standby, and says to me you was just up here asking if you were cleared but you taking your time.

The latter was a significant change, adding 5 hours of travel time (60% longer than originally planned) and disrupting plans both before and after the flight. I called to get a refund based on their cancellation of my original flight and putting me on an unsatisfactory alternative, and was told to file a particular form and I would get a refund on the original payment method within a couple weeks, so to just buy alternative flights that worked better. I followed these directions, but two weeks later, was told that my \u201crefund\u201d would be in flight credits, rather than the original payment method. This violates both their agent\u2019s instructions AND Department of Transportation regulations. Yet, after multiple phone calls and email exchanges, I have been told that there is no possibility of receiving an actual refund. As I followed directions and immediately purchased new tickets, the flight credits are worthless to me \u2014 they essentially duped me into paying double for my tickets and are unwilling to do anything to resolve the situation. It has been a significant waste of my time, and I am furious at the lack of respect from their customer service team. I have no intention of flying American Airlines again.",

I have multiple communication with the representatives from AA that \"there was no charge\". Then, when my credit card bill arrives, surprise! There is a charge. So I politely contact them again and now all of the sudden I have to deal with a third party company and not them - \"it's not their problem\". Yet, I only ever contacted AA?? And they didn't know this 3 months ago? Bait and Switch or just poor service standards? As someone in the service industry, I have made it a point to be professional in behavior and in my communications. This is not a failure on the poor representatives they have contacting me. It's a failure at the C-suite level and that is a shame. This was an easy fix and they failed.",

        "Review": " American Airlines canceled the flight my wife and I were scheduled on, we sat at the ORF airport for five plus hours waiting for it, delay after delay. We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else, we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive, it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled, a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to $4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight! Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us, my brother and his children or my Mom and Step-Dad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can, especially when it's due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase! Also, due to the last-minute flight cancelation, the non-refundable costs we incurred include; TWA hotel @JFK, our portion of the destination accommodations, and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone, they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight! My advice is don't fly American unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination, it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure.",

I made it to the gate before they finished letting on standby passengers but they had already given away my seat and refused to let me on the plane. Then at customer service, they couldn't get me out until late the next day but, since the delay was \"weather\" related, they refused to provide me with any hotel or meal vouchers. Then, at the gate to the next flight, they made me check my bag. Keep in mind that this bag had been fine on the last flight and all of my other flights this week.

They did not offer any vouchers for food or accommodations (we did ask!) We were stuck in New York City with all kinds of things planned in Scotland. We called the customer service line and they were able to get us a flight the next day back to Phoenix and then to London. It took us three days to arrive to Scotland and we experienced a lot of stress and unhappiness, with absolutely no help from American Airlines. We missed a day and 1/2 of the trip we had planned for months. We also are out about $1,000 for incurred expenses. Upon returning home, I emailed to ask how to file a grievance, which is what the employee at JFK advised me to do. I have since heard from two people with no explanation of how to do this. The only thing that they sent is a $25 trip the credit for two of us.

Several passengers in front of me knew as we waited to taxi to the gate they had already missed their connection. The pilot and staff were great. The issue is simple to me. Flights that don't run within 15 min early/late run a huge risk of causing passengers to miss connections. The pilot was transparent in tell us they were assigned to a gate, which was occupied. Then assigned to another gate. Which was also occupied. So we waited on the ground about 20 minutes for an open gate. Don't airports have like 900 gates? I find it ludicrous that the delay was made even worse by the inability of the airport. Charlotte to find a gate. I have a layover, so I won't miss a flight. I guess this review is on behalf of my passengers missing connecting flights, the ludicrous flight connection system, and the entire system itself. I don't want excuses about pilot shortages, luggage handler shortages, import vibration, etc. For $550 for a flight from PA to AL, figure it out.",

In the middle of the page, it said, \"No shuttle: Transport voucher will be available after hotel is booked.\" No vouchers were given at the gate in the airport. No voucher was given by the hotel. No voucher appeared in my American Airlines app. No voucher was offered today as I checked back in for the flight to BUF. We were told that all we had to do was to contact aa.com/refunds to file a claim for the travel to and from the hotel. 1. There is no option on aa.com/refunds to ask for transportation to and from the hotel. 2. A link in the support page asks whether the user would like to chat with support, but the page to which the link leads has no portal to a chat system.

        "Review": " Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare\u00a0of trying to get our flights\u00a0rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever\u00a0have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately\u00a0ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American\u00a0throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements,\u00a0being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to\u00a0treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency.\u00a0Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster.\u00a0",

This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It's not just about their lack of willingness to work; it's also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn't deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn't even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money. In any way, the time I lost, the frustration I had for a couple of days. These were all enough for me to never ever use this company. This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I am sorry that it turned out this way.",

        "Review": " I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.",

My first flight was delayed two hours and even though I got to my connecting flight before the schedule departure time, the plane had already left. They said that we weren\u2019t even scheduled on that flight even though we were. Their system had automatically rescheduled me without my approval because they \u201cthought we wouldn\u2019t make it\u201d. When trying to get a new flight with the AA agent, she was huffing and puffing like she was annoyed with us as we were trying to find the best flight that would work for us. When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren\u2019t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time.",

When I get to airport the representative tells me the 800am left on time. She is not sure why they changed my flight to 1000am. I do - they bumped me off my flight. So my connecting flight in DFW will be missed because I arrive at 1140am and my connecting flight leaves at 1047 am. The DFW flight I paid for a seat which means nothing to AA. Now I\u2019m on standby in Dallas waiting to see if I get on a 500pm or 900pm flight. AA so conveniently change your flight regardless of the fact you PAID for your flight and seat!

The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard.",

They made me wear a different mask because apparently there was something wrong with my mask, even though I passed through security and had just got off a previous plane without anybody making me switch masks! As soon as I sat down, she told the other attendant to make sure I was wearing the new mask. Then they continued to target me on the plane by telling me my pillow needs to be stored under the seat, which is a lie! No airplane carrier makes you do that. Then the older lady told me to put my phone on airplane mode as I was finishing a text. I told her to give me one second and I will put it on there, but then she yelled at me saying, \u201cNow! Put it on airplane mode now!\u201d So I did. Then the same lady came back a minute later to harass me again and said \u201cI need your phone on airplane mode.\u201d I told her that I did the first time she asked and showed her the airplane symbol on my phone. Then she got an attitude and left. I will never fly with this airline again.",

I was recently a passenger on a flight from Charlotte to New Bern, North Carolina. It had been a weekend. I was boarding the plane. With two bags strategically positioned but still somewhat awkwardly, on my person making my way to my seat. I was wearing new platform sneakers I treated myself to. It had been a year. I think we can all relate. The person in front of me stopped in his tracks to snatch up a spot to place his item in the \u201coverhead bin\u201d. So I had to stop mid step and took a step back. Of course, this happened to be right in front of someone of your staff sitting in one of the rows. He looked at me and said \u201ctoo much to drink?\u201d I felt instantly embarrassed. Because he wasn\u2019t quiet and discreet. \u201cNo sir\u201d I said. but thank you. What I wanted to say was, I did have a glass of wine prior to boarding. But thank you for assuming that I was drunk. Not that I\u2019ve spent a last minute whirlwind weekend with my family in Massachusetts, after 14 months of not seeing them due to Covid. Not seeing my father with kidney failure for fear of bringing the pandemic to his door step, as I am a primary care nurse practitioner. It wasn\u2019t the weight of a weekend spent desperately making up for lost time and salvaging moments. Not being exhausted staying up with him because he was too afraid to asleep. You don\u2019t know me. I don\u2019t know you. In a world that is already struggling. Be kind. Do not assume the worst. As much as anyone, I know the importance of safety. Ask if I am ok. Or say nothing at all. When I really wanted to answer with, if only it was that simple. I am not sure what your company has identified as core values, but where I work, these interactions would be unacceptable. Sensitivity training. Invest in it.",

I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing. In the future I will just fly into DFW and drive the 3 hours to San Angelo. I will also never fly American Airlines itself again because of their partnership with this atrocious airline.",

Luckily 4 people offered to stay back because they were given 1,000 vouchers once we got to Philly they had overbooked that flight by 2 people and a seat was broken. For whatever reason, my boarding pass didn't have a seat or boarding number on it. This was extremely stressful due to the fact that there are only 2 flights a day that fly into Bangor. 3 people had to stay behind that day. How they get away with one booking.

Even though the tickets were still same price for the next day as the ones I purchased, I was charged 150 dollars for the change. Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA. I was very disappointed that Southwest Airlines do not fly to Billings, MT or I would have definitely flown SWA - No hidden fees, no baggage fees, no fees for changing flights, and amazing customer service!",

When I called the customer service number, they had no clue of how to handle this issue. I filed a report online, but they didn't even respond to that. It shows how careless the employees are with customers' property. They lost something which they themselves found! In less than 12 hours they couldn't even transport it from the gate to the lost and found department. Pathetic.",

Today I scheduled a connection with an extra hour of connection time, but it is not enough. I am going to miss the connection. I fly internationally quite often and have given up trying to fly American Eagle for those trips, because missing the connection is not something you can recover from. The thing I hate the most is the way they say, delayed 20 minutes. Then delayed an hour. Then delayed an hour and 10 minutes. Then delayed two hours. etc. If the delay were at least estimated with a little more accuracy, then a person could make plans. The problem is that the planes are so ancient that there are constant maintenance problems. This airline, like nearly all US carriers, is a mess. It is just terrible. If I had any choice at all about travel, I would not fly American Airlines, but in my town there are very limited options.

The staff had to go get a supervisor. He said she could not find it because my flight had been changed to depart at 8pm. Instead of gate 29 we were now 49. We walked to 49. I looked at my phone and at 417pm and got an alert starting the flight would be late. I was already at the ticket desk by then. Then after sitting for two hours next to gate 49 they announced my flight gate had changed to 1. I have a fused foot and if my daughter had not been with me I would not have made that walk with my luggage in time. I will never fly American Airlines or its affiliates ever again.",

Generally unfriendly service especially by gate staff that either seem inexperienced or poorly trained. 1 to 1.5 hour delays on O'Hare-Wichita both ways, with a 20 min wait on tarmac at O'Hare from CVG due to no boarding tunnel driver. 3 gate changes at O'Hare within 45 min. Late arrival, arrived at hotel after mignight for AM talk. Coming home, was reassured connection would be no problem, then progressive delays and missed connection. Was told by attendant there would be customer service agent to rebook and arrange hotel, but there was none. Gate staff was grumpy and blithely said no hotel because was weather delay, then I asked her to confirm, she reluctantly called and confirmed it was mechanical. Took 15 min to get hotel voucher 30 min away and told could call for shuttle, called hotel and they said no shuttle and airline \"always does that\". Returned to gate and another 15 for cab voucher, still had to cover tip. Hotel at midnight, rebooked for 8am flight. Meal voucher $7 did not cover meal at airport. Flight itself was average enough, arrived safely. Given option, would not travel on American again.",

Then the gal walked through with a box holing the snacks and just put it in front of each passanger to get their own snack and then they came through with the drink cart, once my snack was already almost gone.

I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight, and if it's other way around, they want our patience - very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I can't stop myself thinking that they can't do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so, and we finally landed to Toronto at 5:00 pm, instead of 2:31 pm. I have nothing more to say about this airplane other than it's stupid and lazy. Only good thing to talk about is that the flight crew lady on the plane was very nice and tried her best to keep us calm. She needs a raise for covering others' problems.",

As there was another plane already there we had to sit on the tarmac for another 20 mins.

What a shambles. Over 3 hrs late the plane took off. After complaining to American Eagle they offered us a $50 voucher valid for 12 months.

        "Review": "  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",

The tickets are very expensive and there is nothing special about the on board 'fare'. The wi-fi on board is good but it is also not complimentary, you have to pay. Again, why not offer that for free to First Class passengers? On the ground in LA I was told that I could not use the Admirals Lounge because it is not for \"First Class domestic passengers\". Again the ticket is very expensive and I don't understand why domestic First Class cannot use the lounges. Dollars per mile, I am sure that American makes more money on their domestic First Class than on their international routes. I had to extend my trip and when I changed my ticket I was charged an additional $358.00!!! Outrageous! So, my ticket ended up costing over $1,200! I will think twice about flying with American when booking my next flight. They only seem interested in making money and not customer satisfaction.",

        "Review": "Salt Lake City to Los Angeles was the worst experience among our four American Airline/American Eagle flights.  I tried to change my Frequent Flyer Number on the self-service kiosk but it didn't work, so I ask one of their check-in lady to do that when she was printing our baggage labels. But I just found out that she did not change it at all as this flight counted in my BA program rather than my CX program I ask her to change. Secondly, the flight was delayed due to technical issue. Which was all fine because people understand that it is for the sake of their lives. However, the AA maintenance in Salt Lake City was so inefficient as it took them more than 40 minutes to arrive at the aircraft and commence the problem shooting. After delayed for about 2 hours, we started to board. However that is not the end, after all passengers took their seats, we have two passengers who did not show up but the aircraft was full. Ground services and the flight attendants counted the number for more than 5 times and decided it was ok. Unfortunately there seemed to be another technical problem which held us for another 30 minutes. The total delay was more than 3 hours and the inflight experience was not good either, both lavatories were out of function shortly after beverage service. My personal opinion towards the AA domestic flight is that it depends on luck if they delay, cancel your flight or lost track of you baggage.",

For takeoff and landing in Australia you must have the window shade up, but as we were coming in to land in LAX not one of the cabin crew came and asked to open the window shade. I could recline in economy during takeoff and landing. ",

American Eagle diverted our flight to Washington, DC Reagan and we were made to use shuttle buses from Philadelphia to the terminal going to Reagan. The shuttle buses were dangerously overcrowded and disgusting. The plane a small 50 seat plane was completely filled. My wife and I are senior citizen and I am glad we took baby aspirin before our flight because they very tight seats caused our legs to throb. We met many individuals who complained bitterly about the seat space. Once at Reagan our connecting flight required shuttle buses to the terminal and these were overfilled. There was a mother standing with her infant trying to manage the child and stroller. There was my wife and I just trying to stand. I counted more then 70 people on a bus designed to safely carry 50. This plane held about 90 passengers and was filled to capacity. Carry ons had to be checked, because the overhead compartments were unable to accommodate the newly approved carry on luggage. The flight was a horror and took much longer then the direct flight we had booked. The plane was dirty and disgusting. For a Thanksgiving holiday American Eagle should be ashamed.",

Seemed to be quieter than a Boeing 737 I am so used to flying on. It was also nice that there are only 2 seats across on both sides, and only 75 passengers. This makes embarking and disembarking much quicker. The full flight loaded in 15 minutes and left on time. Beware though, smaller plane means smaller overhead luggage bins, which means carry ons that fit easily in a 737 for example, might be a tight squeeze on this plane. I slept on the flight and missed service. There is no on board entertainment on these planes, just wifi which I did not connect to. I was in a main cabin extra seat, and honestly, I didnt notice the extra space. I am short so it really is not a factor. However, it was a benefit to be among group 1 boarding and towards the front of the plane.",

After waiting until after 8 we were told the lav was not working and we would be given vouchers and fly out at 7.30 the next morning. We were not helped to find transportation to our hotel although it was late on a Sunday evening and the airport was closing down. We finally got to our hotel at 9.45. Left the next morning at 6 but didn't take off until 8.30 - were told the bathroom issues were still not fixed and we would have to land in Memphis for people who needed a bathroom break. We were forced to deplane take all our luggage off then told there were hydraulic problems. We finally left Memphis after 1 and landed at DFW after 3. The people in Greensboro were not helpful nor did we ever feel that we were given accurate information about what was going on. A miserable experience.",

        "Review": "For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage). I have also heard flight attendants and gate agents confirm the poor operations of this carrier. Fly with American Eagle at your risk.",

Upon arriving at the airport I checked the boards to double-check that my flight would take off at the same gate as listed on my boarding pass. However when the time came my flight wasn't listed. Upon asking about the flight I was informed that they had changed gates (from B21 to B9 far from my location). However they did not announce any gate changes. I was informed that they don't announce gate changes unless it's less the change is made in the last two hours. Thus I waited 3 hours (with false information) and missed my flight.

When we arrived, we discovered that some how my mother's luggage had been lost. I'm not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 1/2 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my mom's bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle, get a rental car and drive about 2 1/2 hours away to Ocean Shores. This put us way behind schedule and left my mom with NOTHING - no clothes, no toothbrush, no heart medication. She trusted that Delta would get her bag to its location. For Pete's sake, we weren't taking an international flight with layovers! The next morning Delta called and said they located my mom's bag but that they couldn't deliver it to us because we were too far away and they couldn't ship it via UPS because it was a holiday. By the time Delta would have been able to ship my mom's bag to us, we would have already been returning to the airport at the end of our short vacation. My mom paid to check her bag both ways ($60) just to not have any access to it - plus the stress of not knowing where it was, waiting for hours, and the inconvenience of having none of the items that she brought to accommodate her vacation. She had to spend about $150 of replacement clothes, toothbrush, etc. I contacted Delta after the trip and requested nothing other than that they refund the $60 we paid to check the bag both ways. They would only offer a flight credit good for 12 months.... UNBELIEVABLE. We will not be flying in 12 months so I again asked for a cash refund instead. They refused.

The connection flight was delayed as well for about 1h, then finally we boarded the connection flight. The pilot then told us that there is something wrong with the engine that they would attempt to resolve the issue. About 45min later the pilot told us that we will be asked to deplane as this issue would not be resolved today. He also said that he had been flying for 16 hours straight and would not be able to take us to our destination even if they found another plane. The customer service line was extremely long and after 1h30 AM wait, an employee told us that unfortunately there was no more voucher for hotels. At the same moment we all start receiving rebooked flights notices for 9:30pm, so we were to stay at the airport for 20h. When I spoke to the staff they were very dismissive. I informed them that i have a hip issue and could not sit or stand for so long but they told me to go find myself a hotel and maybe Delta would refund me $100 of it. I asked that they get me my luggage back because i needed to take my blood pressure medication but they said i would have to wait until it arrives in MD. I bought a ticket with Southwest for $200 and was able to get home. Delta is only offering to refund the part of their flight that i did not use, but i paid more last minute with Southwest to get home. ",

Going into Hawaii every family needs agricultural forms to fill out, this flight didn't have enough forms and NO pens! They told us a million times the flight was full, so take your own advice and have enough stuff for everyone. They made everyone who did not have a form stay on the flight until they got more forms and filled them out. As a first class passenger with my bags tagged priority they are supposed to come out first, we'll they came out almost last! Flight home, no drinks while waiting for everyone to board, my husband had no blanket and pillow like everyone else in first class, he asked for it, they brought him two blankets because they were out of pillows. He ordered a special meal which they did NOT have!! The only option for dinner was a turkey sandwich and chips!

I spent $6000 for two tickets. Our seating area had been left uncleaned and unsanitized. Our chairs were left broken, with broken head phones and wifi that I purchased. For international leisure or business travel I would highly suggest another airlines.",

They were both loud, constantly talking and laughing, slamming doors, behaving like they were at home hanging out in their living room. It was hard to sleep on the flight or just close my eyes for a little to rest. Very disappointing because all of the customers in first class were quiet and well behaved.

This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be \"at least an hour,\" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be \"at least\" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and reached out professionally to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account. Turns out that 3,000 miles are worth about $30. I have seen overbooked Delta flights offer people credit cards for $500 or more, just like that. I lost so much time and money with this experience. I asked if I could talk to someone else, remaining friendly with the individual since I know it's a company policy and customer service staff are not to blame, but the email I got back said, \"Thank you for writing us back. I've utilized all my resources and have been advice by my leadership team that no further compensation can be issued. Regrettably we're unable to honor your request. We realize this is a disappointment, and trust you understand our position. We do appreciate your persistence but we will have to agree that we cannot find the right solution this time. Any further communication would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this incident. We hope in time we'll have the opportunity to restore your confidence in our service. Take care and have a wonderful day!\" \"We will not respond again regarding this incident\". Delta has completely lost its once-great customer service and has gone downhill with mileage benefits, cost, seating options, and the whole experience. They try to scrape money from travelers in any way they can and offer us nothing when they mess up. Delta has lost my trust.",

Before we arrived at the airport, we were constantly checking the Delta app, and it always showed that the flight was on time. When we checked in (3 hours before our flight) the counter person let us know there was a \"slight\" delay. We were in the airport from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m. At 11 p.m. Delta announced that the flight would be delayed until 11 a.m. the next morning. We went back to the counter, and the counter person took quite a while to find a solution that would allow us to arrive at our final destination, Phoenix. We were somewhat confused because other airlines (JetBlue) still had flights that were flying out that night to JFK. The counter person finally found a solution for us. The solution involved sending us to a hotel, where we would spend one night. Then from the hotel, a taxi would pick us up and drive us 5 hours to a completely different airport (Punta Cana.) We did make it to the Punta Cana airport on time and were able to get on a flight to Dallas and connect on to Phoenix. One of the stresses that occurred was that the hotel that the Delta ticket counter person sent us to was full. When we arrived at the hotel at 11 p.m., the hotel manager said that there were no more rooms available. After more than 30 minutes, they were able to squeeze us all in 1 room, with my daughter sleeping on a cot on the floor. The following morning, the taxi driver (that Delta provided) was a very unsafe driver. We were in the taxi with him for 5 hours. He drove all over the road, cars and buses honking at him, he talked on his cell phone, stopped to buy street food, asked us for gum, and when he dropped us off at the airport he asked us for a tip 3 times. We gave him $10 but he truly scared us the whole trip.",

Their original flight was on June 17, their flight was cancelled so to a very good reason. I received an email that their flight was rescheduled to 6/18/23. When my family received their ticket they went to the gate that was printed on their ticket. Come to find out there was a gate change and my family wasn\u2019t told of it. My Mother was treated so badly by delta in Seattle. My Mother told it was her fault for not having the app on her phone. My family got put on stand by and was separated on the plane. For my 4 year old to not be seated next to someone she knows is unacceptable. It took a passenger to speak up and trade seats with my 4 year old to sit next to my Mother. I am absolutely mortified that my family got treated so poorly and told it was all her fault for not having the app. This is 100% the worst customer service and we will never fly delta again.",

        "Review": "  Yesterday our family had a Delta airlines return flight back to West Palm Beach after an awesome family wedding in NYC this weekend. The flight was confirmed on time throughout the day. Just as we walked into LGA, DELTA canceled the flight. Waiting on Long lines to find out what DELTA will do to get us home. Also on phone, maybe another airport\u2014 what about other NYC airports, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington \u2014 nothing available. What about flights to any city in Florida and we can drive from there? Nothing? Check the trains, nothing available. Did DELTA have a responsibility to get us home? The airlines answer was NO. Can we take the next available flight to anywhere in Florida? Sure, DELTA tells us that\u2019s in 5 days on Saturday. Hey airlines \u2026 we work, we have responsibilities, a life to get home to, our dog\u2026 what about that? What about my Medallion status as a loyal customer? No doubt, DELTA airlines stranded us with no options without even an apology. No apology sent to my Delta app, email, nothing! No refund sent to my card either for that matter. In all my decades of air travel, I have never seen anything like this. Delta claims the massive cancellations are due to weather, which they cannot justify on the east coast route. Today still stuck on account of the supposed \u201cbad weather\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s no hurricane, tornado or even a thunderstorm. The sun is bright. As of now, we\u2019re driving to Richmond for a flight we found on Jetblue to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. That\u2019s means 2 days lost just trying to get get home. Our flight to NYC on Sunday was also canceled but DELTA kindly re-routed us and we did finally make it to the wedding albeit late. I\u2019m concluding there is a systemic problem. Something is clearly broken unfortunately. Hopefully our plane Thursday will take off. ",

So around 11pm we boarded the plane. The pilot said due to weather we had to wait inside for clearance. We waited in that hot smelly aircraft for two hours. Every 30 mins he said we would depart. The steward stayed behind the curtain as we all moaned for air due to low air quality on the plane. A few of us mentioned we felt like passing out. Then they brought out hot water. So what seemed like 3 hrs later they cancelled our flight and many flights. So hundreds of people had to stay overnight. Everyone wanted updates and a new flight. They told us no new flights. We waited in hours for phone as service that offered flights the next day. All the airport agents ran off it was too overwhelming. So I stayed the night at the airport on a bench. Canceled work the next day. All the next day I was walking and talking and checking my phone for updates. A few agents were nearby and set up new flights for me. But every time I checked on my flight it was always at a new gate. And my name was never in the system or the flight don\u2019t exist in their system. It was so weird. So going around in circles. Some agents flat out ignored me. I grab lunch at this blue square blue restaurant.  I also ate at this Parisian style breakfast place. Meet a waitress who connected me with the right people to finally get an actual ticket for me out of sfo. So the next day I boarded a plane at 5pm. Again it was another delay.

The airline and airport were unprepared for this situation so we were forced to deplane several minutes later. Attempting to call customer support did not work due to considerable hold times. With face-to-face customer support (from the gate and the customer support helpdesk) I was informed the plane may not take off for about six hours after the original time (as another aircraft would probably be needed), and thus I switched to a flight about four hours after the original time. However, in actuality there was another craft found and so the delay would only have been two hours. Upon learning this, I went back to the helpdesk and pointed out this information, but they said I could not be put back on the original flight and no refund was possible. The individuals I interacted with were friendly and transparent, but company policies turned what was supposed to be a short flight into a daylong nightmare. Poor quality control and policies relating to customer support have made Delta Airlines more unreliable and inflexible in comparison to similarly priced competitors I have experienced the highs and lows of air travel with.",

The food was poor at best, and mostly inedible. They delayed/misplaced one of our check-in bags, the one that had our house keys in it. It was our fault to leave our keys in a checked in bag, trusting the bag would make it to our final destination. But it was almost 24 hours until our bag was returned. We spent the night in a hotel near our house until someone could let us in the next day. Delta is the only airline in my entire history of flying which has lost my luggage .. twice now. They also removed and discarded all of our personal luggage tags. We have no idea why they would do this. Also, on our initial Comfort Plus flight out of the country to London, they cancelled my ticket when I stated I was having a slight allergic reaction to something. This is understandable. But they would not let me fly again without a doctors note stating I could do so. The next day when we tried to book another flight, they charged us an additional $700 each and placed us in the back of Economy. No Comfort Plus seats, which we'd paid for. With the additional $700, this made our tickets $1700 each, one way. Do not fly this airline. It's not worth whatever price savings you may receive.",

We arrived to the delta counter so happy to check in our luggage, the agent was so rude and told us that our flight was at 5:30 and left already. We told him about the text and email. He did ignored us and said step to the side and he can\u2019t do anything about it. We went back to the line again to ask what we need to do and another agent was as rude as the first one and no one tried to take responsibility for it. We called West jet and they we\u2019re trying to tell us that our tickets are with Delta reservation number and it\u2019s their responsibility. Long story short Delta didn\u2019t do anything to help us and we lost our two nights hotel ( Thursday night in Toronto and Friday night in Niagara fall and car rental.

On the afternoon before our 6am flight to MSP and on to HNL, we received a message from Delta that our equipment changed and that on the Minneapolis to Honolulu flight (8 hours) my wife was in a coach seat. After spending hours on the phone we were informed that the only way we could get Delta One seats for both of us was to fly to Detroit, spend the night, and then fly to Honolulu the next morning, thus losing one day in Hawaii of our vacation. We did so and, upon arriving at the check-in in Detroit, there was no Delta One seat for my wife, and she had an 8 hour flight in coach (I would have traded with her, but I am 6'4\": and could not fit in her seat). We finally made it to Hawaii on a very sour note for our anniversary and when we checked in for our return flight my wife was again in coach. After hours on the phone with Delta and Delta Vacations, we were told we both had Delta One tickets but could not confirm until we arrived at the airport. There is no way to call the Delta agent in Honolulu, and Delta reservations has no control over the flight the 24 hours before the flight. We did have Delta One seats when we got to the airport, but not next to each other as I have originally booked 3 months before. After arriving home after the 46th Anniversary trip from hell, thanks to Delta, I filed a complaint and waited for a communication regarding refunding the difference between my wife's Delta One and coach seat. That has been 6 days and I've heard nothing from Delta (I am currently on hold and have been so for an hour). This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Do not book Delta.",

This is their method to rip off costumers. You buy a ticket and then they charge you at the airport for any baggage you have. It's like charging for using the toilet on the plane. It's an industry standard that it's included in transatlantic flights that cost minimum $1000+ for the very basic ticket. Besides that, the food was horrible, small portions and not tasty at all. There were no tablespoon, toothpick, salt and pepper. The trays were dirty and I had to clean them my self. The flight attendants begged us not to ask for headphones or headsets because they had limited amount and not enough for every passenger. There is also a very limited amount of movies and TV shows compared to United. I couldn't find something nice to watch. Bottom line - I'm very disappointed and I will not fly Delta again.",

The kiosk wouldn\u2019t scan my passport for whatever reason. Asked an agent to help. He made a face like I asked him to move a mountain. Without even trying he asked me to go back to \u201cagent assist\u201d which was the original line I wanted to join. Now, that line was huge and it took over 30 minutes for my turn. The Asian guy at the checkin counter was the only positive thing about this process. He was smiling and doing his job with the right attitude. I was not assigned a seat because it was a last minute emergency booking. I stood in the line at the boarding area to get one assigned only to be asked to come back later. 20 minutes later, back in the huge line. Half way through, boarding starts and guess what.. the same employee is responsible to help with that too. No one knew which line to join, what group what not.  Nothing against the employee at the boarding area, but the process in general was the issue. After almost everyone boarded I was finally assigned a seat and allowed to board. ",

To our surprise, at the time of pre-check in the day before the flight, my husband appears assigned to row 30 of the plane while I appeared in row 18, I think. We decided to arrive at the Boston airport early to try to get seats together and there they tell us that we should try to do it at the boarding desk, we were waiting there until a Delta employee showed up there and with a very bad attitude told us that we had to wait until 3 PM without guarantee to talk about this and he got to talk on the phone for an hour and a half. After 3 PM, he simply left and left me and 4 other people waiting in line because their boarding passes did NOT have assigned seats. We waited and waited and when we saw that the screen said that the boarding process would start in 20 minutes and there was no one there, I went to the desk of the next flight to tell the lady from Delta that there was no one to attend us and the screen It said that the boarding began in 20 minutes. She called on the phone and finally another employee came running and told me that if my husband and I were on the same reservation, she would try to seat us together and she kept both boarging passes. The passengers began to board and I had to remind him that I did not know which group I belonged to because I had 2 assigned seats in very distant rows and it was there that he verbally told me that we would be together in Main Cabin 1. When they called that group, we still did not know what were our seats but in the middle of the row the employee finally printed the tickets that I show in this review. In the middle of the flight, when I went to the bathroom, I saw that all the people who were in line with me waiting to see which seat they were going to be assigned, were sitting in the last rows. The truth is that I do not understand why Delta mistreats its customers like this. I think that everyone, even those of us who pay for cheap tickets, deserve a minimum of respect and consideration.",

Avoid this airline if you are a woman traveling alone, are traveling with a pet or have a fishing vacation and plan to travel with your rod and reel.  Although I bought an \"airline approved pet carrier\" and checked and rechecked dimensions (experienced with a tape measure) I was informed the carrier was too large and I would need to buy one there (unsure of mark up but willing to pay whatever the cost). I was kept at the counter a long time while the agent and her supervisor searched for a carrier to sell me. They were out and told me I would need to book a later flight while they obtained one. This was not an option because my son was already in Utah. I called my daughter back to the airport to take my cat to my ex as she is unable to keep him. Returned to the counter where the supervisor loudly told the ticket agent to find out what I had \"done\"with the cat. I checked two bags one being my son's camping gear where the supervisor informed the ticket agent that my sons rod and reel couldn't be in his pack and security would determine if I could carry it with me. It was only a $100 rod but had tremendous sentimental value. Security said it was fine and people take fishing trips with their gear. I made it to the gate (I was over 2 hours early) after it had already boarded and the supervisor met me there to inform me that she herself would not allow me to board with the rod. I put the rod in garbage can (she continued to argue for a later flight while they \"obtained\" another carrier). All together this 4 hour one way economy flight cost me around $1200 and I was made to choose between my son and my best friend of over 8 years. I can't tell you the trauma this has caused me because this woman was desperate for whatever mark up or commission she got from that carrier. I miss my cat all day everyday. You can save a lot of money choosing a different airline and worst case scenario you receive comparable service. This is insignificant but the website asked about food and beverage- the extra money doesn't even get you a full can of coke. They fill multiple glasses from the same can. Insignificant but gross.",

The meals alone were more than that. Will not be flying with them again after the way they treated us. Only communication is through email. Never can get anyone on the phone. Was told next time to go to red coats for meal voucher which we did and they said they will be issued at our home airport, when we got there they knew nothing about what we were talking about.

Initial flight leaving PDX was substantially delayed so rebooked, same routing. That flight was just a little late, had plenty of time in SLC, no problem. Especially since THAT flight was substantially delayed. Got in to DFW 6 hours later than planned. Return flight, delayed just enough that the only flight to be on time, the last leg, taking me home, was already pushed back when I got to the gate. Delta kindly rebooked me on a flight the next day and of course, no room. Fortunately the gate agent found a seat on a flight later that evening so I only have to wait 5 hours. I assume they used the same computer and data base that Delta Corporate uses, so I am not sure why the company didn't book me there in the first place. Going back a few months, I had a flight get delayed and delayed and then finally they sent me a text that it was delayed until the next morning. Same scenario, no help for accommodations and since they \"delayed\" it, well that's not the same as \"cancelled\" so they have no obligation to help or refund. In that case, I had to be in the destination city before the flight was scheduled to depart so I rented a car and drove all night. I only flew Delta this time because they were a \"preferred airline\" for the corporate travel department I was booking through. I cannot fathom why. Now, the staff at Delta are all very nice, they are as helpful as they can be, but there isn't much they can do when flights are delayed. So thanks to the staff. But your airline sucks. They have posters in the jetway, \"This is what service looks like\". \"This is what happiness looks like\". How about one that says \"This is what on-time looks like\"? The only reason they get two stars rating is because their staff is so nice. \"Value for money\"? They have cost me car rentals, lost time on the job. Money.",

We contacted baggage services and they told us the bags were in Paris and would be put on a flight the next day and we would have them by 9 PM.

At 9:15 PM we were told that the bags would be coming in the next day (today). At 1000 today we found one bag loaded onto an Alitalia flight from Naples (they never made it to Paris to begin with), and that it would be transferred to a flight to Atlanta today.

We shoved his stuffed animal and my Fanny pack into a bag and then she said my mothers purse which was smaller than my Fanny pack was a bag then grabbed one of our rolling bags and told the other woman working there to \u201ccheck it in\u201d. She said \u201cyou\u2019ll get it when you get off\u201d then pushed us through. The guy behind us who was on the flight explained since it\u2019s a connecting flight we would pick it up at the turnstile in Albany. It was very stressful and so upsetting to the entire party. The staff onboard were not friendly and the plane was dirty. I was told not to fly Delta but unfortunately the flight was cancelled through the other airline for returning so my choices were very limited. My flight to Orlando was with Jetblue and they had the same written instructions on the website for bags and we did not have any issue with a Fanny pack, a purse and a stuffed monkey being counted in our bags. I would rather drive the 23 hours back home than ever put my family through that nonsense again. The movie screens had to be fixed a couple of times and some passengers still didn\u2019t have a working one. The seats were super uncomfortable. I 100% honestly have never written a bad review for any business but felt it was necessary to share the terrible experience we had with Delta.",

        "Review": "  I had the nightmare flight experience from Delta Airlines. My recent trip from Boston to Shanghai was a complete disaster. Delta Airline flight DL509 got delayed 3 hours and made me arrive late in Los Angeles from Boston. This made me miss my connecting flight to Shanghai with China Airlines. Second, Delta Airlines changed my entire trip without notifying me. I found out my flight changed the next day from my travel agent. Delta changed my entire trip and made me use their airline to fly back to China instead of flying with China Airlines. The new trip now forced me to fly to Seattle and then fly to China through Delta Airlines. This forced me to stay in a hotel for 2 nights and the 2nd night hotel I had to pay out of pocket. Third, Delta Airlines then tried to make me purchase a Main Cabin class ticket for the 3rd day flight to China on their Airlines. This was an $800 ticket which they said I have to purchase in in order to get on the only next available flight to China. So, for them making me miss my connecting flight I had to pay $800 just to fly back and also I had to spend $200 the second night for a hotel in Seattle so I can catch the flight to China the 3rd day is ridiculous. Finally, when I took their flight to China on the third day and arrived in China they lost my luggage. I had important items in my luggage which I had to give to my relatives and now its gone and they are still trying to find it. Delta mentioned specifically that I did not need to worry about my luggage when my flight got changed by them. This entire trip made me feel like a helpless homeless person for 3 days and as an old 70 year old man my health deteriorated greatly from the stress they caused me. There\u2019s no shame in the horrendous customer service they provided and I was never compensated by Delta Airlines for the distress they caused me.",

        "Review": "  April 5th we travelled from Sydney to Mexico City and Cabo to Sydney on April 25th, 2023. We booked premium economy after looking at reviews. I've travelled Premium economy with Air Canada once previously. Sydney to LA was very comfortable with the foot rest and ample room. The seats go back far enough for me to sleep quite well. We received a menu and could choose from 2-3 options at dinner and breakfast. There were different wines to choose from as well. Food was great and it was so nice to eat off plates with proper cutlery and not be knocking elbows. The flights from LA to Mexico City and Cabo to LA were also great. What we didn't realise that because we had booked Premium Economy on our main legs we were in comfort class on the shorter flights. More room, designated cabin storage and choice of snacks. So that was a nice surprise. On our return flight from LA to Sydney there was a marked difference in the quality and choice of food and wine. We had a two choices for main one being vegetarian and no choice for breakfast. The dessert was a small slice. I asked for some fruit but none as forthcoming until breakfast. There was only one white wine offered that being Chardonnay which I don't like. Delta advertises wine and food choices for premium economy and did not deliver on the LA to Sydney leg. We did get noise cancelling headphones to use which was good but just be aware you cant use them with your devices only the entertainment provided so you still may want to bring your own. Also internet did not work LA to Sydney but did Sydney to LA. The amenity bags from LA to Sydney included out of date lotions and vouchers. No access to the lounge which United does include in its premium economy offers. Our return flight was changed to a 7 hour wait in LA so it would have been nice to have had lounge access for something that was not our fault. The Sydney to LA flight was late leaving and we had a 2 hour window to collect our bags , recheck them and get to another terminal to catch our flight to Mexico City. Luckily customs was quick but the baggage carousel stopped and needed a maintenance person. It didn't look like we were going to make it. I know Delta would have to book us onto the next available flight if we missed our flight due to no fault of our own but that does create booking problems. As we ran to the gate the boarding closed sign was up but previous passengers had told them we were on our way and we were able to board. Just! There was no allowance or help given by Delta for something they were responsible for. In hindsight a 2 hour time frame does not take into account any delays so a 3 hour window would be much less stressful or stay overnight in LA. Overall the flight was good, especially Sydney to LA. As we have gotten older we have decided to travel in more comfort and Premium Economy does supply that. I'm nearly 6' tall and no longer as resilient to cramped sitting although our run from one terminal to another with full luggage was quite impressive if I do say so myself!",

How messed up is that, this mega airline is so shameless that just because I didn't book straight through them even when it was them that changed my dates, they won't do anything which totally messes up everything for me, do they care?

We originally had a direct flight and now had to have layovers in separate cities to get home. The reason for the cancellation wasn\u2019t weather related rather it was because they are understaffed and didn\u2019t have a crew to man the plane. From what I was told and read online it\u2019s due to Delta forcing the vaccine on their employees and the employees either resigning or are fired. Their choice of compensation was issuing 10,000 miles which is essentially $100. This cancelation forced us to miss Easter with the rest of family. The part that is frustrating is they knew there wasn\u2019t a crew to man the plane and waited until the following morning to rebook everybody and give no notice only a time for check in. Needless to say this sounds like something Southwest or Spirit would do, not Delta.",

To start, every passenger made it on time but the pilot caused about an hour delay because he didn\u2019t show up and we had to sit and wait after boarding for Delta to find another pilot. If you know the captain isn\u2019t here or running late don\u2019t squish everyone onto your cramped plane. Then I happen to be sitting next to the emergency exit and was trying to make sure I had the procedure of opening the emergency door solely by the illustration in the pamphlet when the delta lady butted into my conversation with my wife to correct me by mentioning the door will open itself after lifting the lever and I would go with it if I was still holding onto it. I jokingly said I guess I\u2019d be the first off. Apparently her sense of humor is poor because then she threatens to move my seat and gets short with me. She said not to be snarky but she takes her job seriously. That\u2019s fine I get taking you job seriously but learn how to communicate better and don\u2019t come across like such a bitch maybe. That FA completely ruined my flight back home with her nasty attitude. I bit my tongue to avoid it coming to a situation like I\u2019ve seen only on social media where police come escort passengers off the plane. After my little run in with the lady in 13d (your employee) I can almost understand how those situations arise. Oh yeah, and they charged us for our luggage for our flight there and our flight back. My wife used her delta American Express and was informed when checking our bags that we shouldn\u2019t have had to pay. Considering all of these issues I\u2019ve had on ONE flight I do believe we will consider other options when it comes to air travel. ",

At about 6:55 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway. While on the runway we got ready to take-off but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate. They said that the weather had closed and they couldn\u2019t take-off , they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there. They said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate, but by the time they did surprise, the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff. We finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we should\u2019ve been home a little after eight I don\u2019t understand how they couldn\u2019t see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management. I could understand the weather problem, but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation. The flight going over to Ireland and the flight back from London to Atlanta Was fine but strictly chaotic once we got to Atlanta.",

A glorified bus ride. What\u2019s more upsetting is the whole \u201cgoing green\u201d charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task. The portions are a joke for a 10 hours flight, and breakfast is just replica of the American \u201cbeef pockets\u201d.

I was not allowed to reorganize my bags I was demanded to pay over 600us for 4 bags. If I was told on entering the counter that the weight is 40lbs I would have restructured my bags, the staff was rude pay now, give me your credit card, bullying me without giving me the information forehand that the limit was 40lbs. I will not recommend anyone to fly Frontier and the flight over 20 seats was empty. I would prefer signs posted in the airport to share information with customers.

My hope is that the voucher can be added to the flight I already purchased for tomorrow. In other news, while attempting to cancel my earlier flight from today, I was met with great difficulty via the app (possibly resulting from the aforementioned update?) After going in many circles with the chatbot and waiting something like 35 min for a representative to arrive on the chat, I got frustrated and began searching for a phone number online to which I found a number claiming to connect me to the Philadelphia airport Frontier desk, but rather, connected me to a third party scammer who ended up \"canceling my flight\" with you somehow (likely getting a refund of some sort themselves) while simultaneously charging me an additional fee to cancel. While I don't expect any kind of reparations for that as it was a result of my own impatience/frustration. I'm guessing by my talks with other frustrated customers, that they are equally frustrated when trying to resolve issues with your airline, which can't be good for business. Having been a supporter of your airline in the past and knowing of your former bancruptcy claim, and fully understanding the role of chatbots, etc.in today's society; I fully believe that an investment in more customer care personel, empowering those people to resolve things beyond the standard voucher system and realistically solving all the other issues with unreliability that seemingly are plagueing your airline as of late so that the necessity for resolvement becomes negated is the only way through your current situation. Will I recoup from the loss of a few hundred bucks and my elevated stress levels and missed appointments, connecting flights and opportunities to use my time how I so deem necessary? Of course, but I (and the rest of your dwindling customer base) really shouldn't have to.",

I always want to give airlines a chance and this is my 2nd time with Frontier and once again it reminded me why I shouldn\u2019t fly this airline. They delayed my flight twice and claimed that my pocket on my small purse was touching their bin where they measure bags so they charged me $100. This ridiculous! If you can afford a better airline or maybe save a bit more for a different airline then do it! I have been so stressed out with this airline that I literally have a migraine. They claim that your bag needs to be a certain measurement but what they really mean is, make sure your bag slides in the bin and there\u2019s plenty of room around without even letting the slightest piece of your luggage touch the bin.

        "Review": "  By far the worst flying experience of my 45 years. The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent.  No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know. If I choose to stay (at the expense of 2 lost vacation days), will I have hotel covered? Yes, but meal and hotel won't happen until 3 PM. Remember this is now 5 AM for a 10:27 PM flight, and all passengers have been awake through the night because of their stupid conditions. Eventually, I book tickets on United and decide to eat the loss.",

And then at the airport all the check in machines were broken, so if you want a boarding pass printed they will charge you $5, I also did my check in the day before but for some reason the check in didn\u2019t show up so I tried to do it again and the lady at the counter told me to do it and it will be 25$ so of course I tried again with the only one machine that finally worked, but even though I got the ticket 2 months early when they told me I don\u2019t have a seat and I had to pay 50$ for the seat, I asked the lady why didn\u2019t I have a seat, she said because the flight was oversold!

When searching for a flight I found the prices posted as very attractive, later on I found that this airline charges extra for everything. If you want assistance at the check-in counter (not automated) you have to pay extra, they charge for a carry-on, meaning everything you might have in your hands have to pay extra, if you check-in your luggage, you will have to pay and then suffer the terrible customer service at the counter. The lines are so slow that it almost made me lose my flight. They charge if you want to select a seat, they charge for water, nothing is free here and at the end the cost of the flight was very similar as Delta. Don\u2019t be fooled, this airline is not the deal you think you are going to get. On the other hand, where are the rights of the consumers?",

They don\u2019t even care about their passengers.

The pinnacle of their incompetence came in the form of a tardy email, attempting to apologize for their abysmal service. Frontier Airlines' late apology email is merely a feeble attempt to pacify disgruntled customers who have suffered through their abysmal service. Their claim to strive for the \"best travel experience possible\" is nothing short of a hollow marketing slogan. If you value your time, money, and sanity, I strongly recommend avoiding Frontier Airlines at all costs and strongly advise against choosing Frontier Airlines. Their empty promises, lengthy refund timelines, and overall incompetence make them an airline that simply cannot be trusted.",

The checked suitcase was checked under one of my in-laws who was part of our traveling party assisting a family wedding at SDQ. The party consisted of 3. All of our wedding and dressing attires were in this bag. Most items hold a high sentimental value aside from the incur cost of the items purchased to assist our family event. To this date we have not received any news after a file claim as to the whereabouts of our belongings or status of the same. Our stay in San Juan, Puerto Rico has been a disaster because of this Airline\u2019s irresponsibility of managing personal property and keeping passengers informed of the process. No one else's personal property(ies) were lost except ours. This was a full one legged flight from SDQ to SJU. We are currently staying at La Concha Hotel in San Juan, PR with a return date back home to Florida, USA on July 15. We still have no news or information regarding our bag to this date.",

I missed my connection. No refund was issued. Then the return had to be changed. I was charged both a charge fee for 99 dollars and a cancellation fee for 99 dollars. They double dipped and would not refund even one of the fees. I would have been ok with either a change fee or a cancellation fee but not both. So then I bought a whole new ticket so I actually paid them 3 times for the flight. In summary, an original 112 dollar ticket became over a 400 dollar ticket. It would have been cheaper to just use a reputable airline like American. On top of all that they stuck me in the middle seat. Now once again I tried booking a new flight with them and they cancelled the 9 pm flight and offered me a 6 am flight. That did not work with my schedule. They also cancelled the return. So this airline advertises routes and schedules but when they do not meet their passenger quota, they just cancel the flights to stay profitable. The hell with the actual people who fly them. Never ever again. Spirit has better customer service than Frontier and that is really saying something.",

As we were arriving at the airport at about 6:00 we received word that our flight was cancelled. We were told that we could not get another flight out of W. Palm Beach until Thursday, 7/13. We were handed a card that we could use to process a refund. The person at the ticket counter was working alone, and, since her terminal was not working was unable to help us other than to tell us we would have to find another flight ourselves. She phoned a superior several times asking for someone to come help her with the long line of angry customers that had, by now formed behind us. No one showed up. We eventually went on-line with our cell phones and determined that there was a flight leaving from Orlando Tuesday 7/11 and we booked flights. That meant we had to rent two cars, drive to Orlando, and then rent two hotel rooms for two nights. The flight that we booked leaving Orlando at 10:30AM was delayed multiple times, the last time because they needed to get a refreshed crew member to the airport, did not leave until after 11:00 PM Tuesday night. We will never fly Frontier again and we are now on a mission to let everyone else know that Frontier's customer service goals are to provide as little service to as few people as possible.",

The people at the counter were rude, if I remember correctly, most airlines have a 50 pound weight limit on a checked in bag, frontier is 40 pounds and if it\u2019s 1 pound overweight it\u2019s an extra $75. The guy at the counter said \u201cOK well I will take your bag off of your hands for $155\u201d. Tickets might be a little cheaper on this airline but trust me they get you in the end.  If you want to choose your seat, it\u2019s anywhere from $40-$65, if not, they assign a seat for you randomly. We had a 6:00 AM flight and TSA did not open up until five it took over an hour to get through security, which is not the airlines fault, but then we had to run for the plane and barely made it on. If you don\u2019t check in at least 24 hours before the flight online, they will not check you in. There was a gentleman at the counter next to us that had the same flight as us but he did not check online and they bumped him to the next flight , that\u2019s horrible! We did a lot of traveling this summer, and flew several major airlines, and had no issues with any of them. I will never fly frontier again, you won\u2019t save any money, it will end up costing you more in the long run for horrible service!",

After boarding the flight in Denver to MSY (F9 478 on 06/30/2023), we were informed the flight has been cancelled; literally after boarding the flight. Didn't give us any reasons on why the flight is cancelled. After waiting in line for more than 2 hours, finally got a chance to speak to the agent at the customer desk. She was the only one who was dealing with all the passengers. She was miserable, and didn't care what the passengers were going through. I was told by her that there is no alternative to get to destination for the next 48 hours. I even requested her whether I could get a flight back to LAS, to which she denied. When asked for other options, I was told I could cancel the itinerary for full refund, and that too I have to claim for it online. Given no choice, I left the desk, filed for refund, and booked a different airline at that last minute for a whopping price to reach the destination. Later I came to know that only a partial refund was issued on my itinerary, I got flabbergasted looking at the email. I filed a complaint with the customer service on the deception. They got back to me saying since the first leg was flown, only a partial refund could be issued, and apologized for the deception with a $50 voucher for future flight travel with Frontier. Who want their credit because I would never ever in my life would choose Frontier again. Also, I will never recommend anyone to chose this airlines. This was my first and will be my last flight experience with Frontier. The airlines and their customer service is so lousy and deceitful, so please never chose this airlines for your travel, if you have a choice.",

We still had to pay 104 dollars per bag. So we elected to check our bags and our children\u2019s car seats.  I was irritated that I was charged 104 per bag but at this point we had no option as it was approaching boarding time. Then we were in line to board our flight (no announcements made at any point that boarding had begun) boarding tickets in hand, when the woman in front of us for whatever reason boarding ticket wouldn\u2019t scan. The woman working for Frontier and scanning boarding tickets then proceeds to close the door to the ramp to board the plane. She then proceeds to tell the woman in front of us and us that we would not be allowed on the plane because we did not arrive prior to their 15 minute boarding warning. Mind you we were in line with everyone else and the door to the ramp was still open. We had zero control over how quick or slow the line moved. She then tells us that the plane is full and our seats are no longer available. That we would need to rebook. I have called their \u201csupposed\u201d customer service line which doesn\u2019t even connect you to a Frontier agent. They have an option to file a complaint online, which I did, and I received an automated response that it could be up to 7 days before I receive a response. The staff were extremely rude. They did not care that I had a 3, 6, and 12 year old with me. That we had no luggage or car seats. They dismissed us like we were trash and they could have cared less. Never in my life have I ever experienced such poor customer service and overall service in general. I will never fly Frontier or recommend them to anyone. We ended up having to rent a car and drive almost 10 hours home. We purchased 5 airline tickets and never flew, paid 312 dollars in luggage fees, and 300 plus for the rental car and car seat rentals.

Frontier got new seats and these a lot comfier and better than the old seats, now with a better sized tray table! It\u2019s nice to have a direct flight to CLE from SAN for us. Far better and calmer experience than LAX. It was a great July 4 experience! Great deal too, the airfare itself excluding extras was $59, though those did add up quickly, but we know that when choosing an ULCC. Ex: Carry on was $65, seats $28/per person. Beware though , they charge $1 more for the middle seat! Why? Also not all planes have the new seating yet, but hopefully it\u2019s coming soon. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not 10/10.",

The flight was delayed, when we got on the plane we were already 40 minutes late. Inside the plane we waited for about an hour or maybe more, and they gave us many excuses as to why the plane was not taking off until finally they told us that we had to get off because it had a damaged engine, after waiting two more hours in the waiting room they canceled the flight without offering more alternatives, most of the passengers had reserved hotels in Punta Cana that they lost because of Frontier, others came from other states or cities in Florida. Even when some passengers complained, Frontier members were upset as if they had been affected.  The worst experience. Please don't throw away or waste your money. Do not use Frontier Airlines.",

The pass allows you to fly for about $15 each way but you are only allowed a personal item (which is about the size of a kids backpack and you cant choose your seat.) anything else will cost extra. Apparently they made changes to their website to now almost no flights are available for anyone using the Go Wild Pass but the seats are available if I were purchasing a regular ticket. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the Frontier Summer Go Wild pass, which I recently purchased in good faith. It is with the utmost disappointment that I bring to your attention the sheer unavailability of flights for the utilization with this pass, rendering it effectively worthless. This has not only wasted my time and money but also tarnished my perception of Frontier Airlines as a reliable and customer oriented airline. Despite the enticing proposition of enjoying flights for a mere $0.01 each, I have found that almost every flight that I attempt to book using the Go Wild pass is inexplicably marked as \"not available.\" This flagrant lack of availability stands in stark contrast to the same flights being readily accessible for regular purchase. The fact that the flights I am interested in are supposedly accessible under normal circumstances only deepens my exasperation. Let me emphasize the tremendous inconvenience and emotional distress caused by this egregious issue. As a customer, I places my trust in Frontier Airlines when I opted to purchase the Go Wild Pass, expecting a fair opportunity to utilize the benefits promised. Regrettably, my experience thus far has been nothing short of an elaborate hoax, leaving me with a sense of betrayal and frustration. Frontier Airlines must be held accountable for this misleading and deceptive practice, which is an affront to customers who believed in the value of the Go Wild Pass.",

        "Review": "  On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was \"Over there\". She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, \"Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)?\", and she said \"No. Over there where the person in green is standing\". So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, \"Then you won't be re-booked\". Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, \"I don't have to give you my name\". That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display. I wonder what corners they cut on their aircraft. It's not worth the cheap ticket. Life is too short. Note: This survey requires I rate the on plane experience, which I cannot do since I never made it onto the flight. However, the survey requires an answer, so I gave it a 1 star.",

I had thought I got a good airline and was leaving to my flight. I did not read reviews or nothing. I had already arranged my schedule to revolve around the trip as in my work, my kids classes, etc. The flight was a two way to where I got to Denver then get on another plane to reach my destination. I got to the airport and I was suspecting on why there wasn't as many people there, but I didn't think much of it. I got on the plane and we were getting ready for take-off and a lady said \"get off the plane your flight was cancelled\" I was confused on why others weren't getting off either and she told me it was for my second flight. I asked if they had another plane that was going to go to my second destination and they said no. which was weird because shouldn't there have been a delay? They told us to reschedule 3 days after which meant , waste of 3 days where I could've been working, waste of 3 days where my kids could be going to class, and waste of 3 days off our trip. I scheduled it and got home. I read the reviews and I could not find one with 5. That was another red flag and I was thinking of refunding it instead and taking a better airline I was familiar with. I went to the airport, they weren't there. I called using the airport phone and left a voicemail. They never answered. I emailed them. They said I had to wait 7 DAYS. Which meant my whole trip. I wouldn't even be able to go anymore if I had waited. I thought I was overthinking it and just went to my next flight that I had rescheduled. What a confidence they had cancelled it AGAIN. Not only that but the workers came way to late for assistance at the desk. I talked to the people in line about it and they all has a similar experience. I paid for an uber 4 times (home to airport, airport to home, home to airport, airport to home) which itself was about $95 which I could have just added to the the ticket price and gotten a much better airline and already been at my destination. I just can't stress this enough for others DO NOT LET THE PRICES DECIEVE YOU. To whoever is reading this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use a different airline. it won't be much more expensive and its way worth it. Please.",

I was unable to apply it a few days later and called and they told me to wait 3-5 business days and try again. I tried again today, July 19 and was again not able to apply it. I then called again and they say they are still unable to apply it on their end. I asked to speak with someone above them and they said they could not even put me in line to talk to a manager due to high call volume. I am now suspicious they are just trying to get me to give up and have no intention of making good on their voucher.

Only flew with Hawaiian to get points as a partner airline to Virgin Australia. Needed to do a claim for insurance on extra costs incurred from this issue (connecting flights and hotels not connected with this booking) extra costs included $500 - wrote in feedback and complaints several times to all channels and ZERO response.

        "Review": " Hawaiian Airlines is really the airline to fly with between the Hawaiian islands. There was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well. Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less \"island-style\" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as \"up and down\" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her \"I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago!\" She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was \"my plane.\" That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these \"up and down\" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.",

They let me on. All my bags did not make it however. Filed a claim at airport on Maui. Was provided a number that doesn't work. Still trying to reach a human and when I do they pass me off to another number that starts with thank you for your patience, but we are helping others and then plays music that is from WW2 cabaret with no response while asking me if I would like to participate in a survey after they don't help me. So here I am with 3 lost bags, no one to help track it down and no one at that airline is hired to care. It is structured incompetence, insensitive employees on an airline that has a monopoly on this island for most inter-island travel. Not sure what to do next as no human ever responds on their phone line, which is recorded for training persons. My best guess is they immediately fire anyone who actually helps!

The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said \"there is nothing we can do\". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because \"we could not understand even is she tried to explain it\" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child. We swore never to travel there ever again because we have never felt so helpless and disregarded and treated so poorly compared to others.",

        "Review": "  This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the \"miscommunication\". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again. Only giving two stars because Joyce was so kind and apologetic to us.",

Despite my explaining the urgency of my situation, your representative informed me that Hawaiian Airlines was not able to help me with my reservation as it was made less than 24 hours ago. This is a policy that was not clearly communicated when I made the reservation. I find this policy to be unfair and unreasonable.

Please stop calling it Champagne when you are serving prosecco! Ground service Horrible in JFK. I had extra baggage and needed to pay for it. It took four staff 35 minutes to process the payment after being passed on to three different check-in desks. Not a word of apology or regret for having me wait for 35 minutes because they did not know how to do their job! My flight was from JFK to KIX with a night stop in HNL  which I did not ask for). I was told they would not through check my luggage to KIX. I had to retrieve all my six bags in HNL, they do not have storage in Terminal 1. Have to drag luggage all the way to Terminal 2, and it's 20$ a piece for overnight storage. Fellow passengers came to my aid with the difficulty in handling my luggage at HNL but the Hawaiian Airlines staff just shrugged it off despite asking for help. The next day when checking in for my flight to KIX at HNL was told I needed to pay for extra bags again but eventually did not have to after some back-and-forth discussions. For Inflight entertainment, ipads are handed out with not much entertainment in them! The business class lounge was full in HNL with a large majority being Priority Pass members so I had to use one downstairs. the choice of snacks and beverages were unimpressive, when I finally made it on my second go. Hotels are not offered by the airline for the night stop in HNL! Moral of the story: Hawaiian Airlines, never again!",

The flight to Hawaii was great as always but on the return flight the day before I tried to check us in and it turns out that Hawaiian Airlines canceled our flight tickets - why ? I have no idea. I called Expedia because that\u2019s who we booked with for our vacation package and they said the airline canceled us and that we would get refunded by them (Hawaiian Airlines). We were left with no flight and it was up to us to look for 2 flight tickets so we could go home. 24 hour before our return really? This is so upsetting because the flight was not even canceled it was just our tickets. Ended up spending more money, missing work and not returning home until 2 days after. I\u2019m still waiting for my refund and till this day I don\u2019t know why this happened when I booked and paid 6 months ahead. I will never be relying on Hawaiian Airlines again!",

My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that \"because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee.\" So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service. You literally could not pay me to take one of their flights out of the Hawaiian islands to their mainland or Asia destinations.",

We filed a 'irregular baggage report' and did the standard protocol. The man at the desk said they would call first thing the following day and let us know our bag whereabouts. The next morning we received no call so decided to call the aiport as we where staying 1.5 hours from the airport. We were put on hold for 3.5 hours and then 2 hours where no one picked up the phone. The following day was the same! On hold for 3 hours and no answer. When someone finally answered they said they had found the bag and would send it out immediately. 2 days later we still hadn't received the bag and once again couldn't get through on the phone to anyone at the airport. We ended up driving to the airport where there were 3 staff working on the hawaiian airline baggage desk not serving anyone talking amongst themselves.

This was disappointing and frustrating and, from my experience, not in line with industry standards for any other American or international carrier I have used (aside from deeply discounted budget brands). Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. You don't want to be in my situation where an error caught in 15 minutes means you forfeit your $$$.

It started with them canceling my husbands and I\u2019s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the \u201cservices\u201d line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we weren\u2019t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If you\u2019re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have \u201cissues\u201d with people sneaking bags or something - no, it\u2019s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policy\u2019s. Unfortunately I already booked multiple flights with them the next month because they pop up the cheapest. But out of principal and their treatment of military and corner cutting I won\u2019t fly with them anymore. Military and their spouses already have a hard enough time traveling around, paying for way more flights than normal people, so it\u2019s clear how they feel about military. And before anyone says anything about military occupation, we all Know big corporations don\u2019t care about that. They just want their $30 dollars, and to make sure they hire as little employees as possible. Also the seats are squished together so even as a small woman I\u2019m shoulder to shoulder with people and can barely move. It was a nightmare trying to get comfortable",

The woman told me I would have to upgrade my seat because coach does not have outlets but extra comfort does have them so I had to pay over $900 for upgrade for my wife and I to use my medical device. Only allowed 100 watts for a battery and that\u2019s not enough to run a cpap machine. Flight from JFK to HNL no problem used the machine 5 star. Return flight from HNL to JFK I was told cpap machines are not allowed on the plane. I told the lady I was approved to use it. They called the supervisor and he said it is a safety issue I cannot use it. I said it is only a safety issue if it is used in the emergency exit, and this is not where I am sitting. Told him I was allowed to use it on flight 51 on the way to HNL. He said no I cannot use my machine on an overnight flight, my throat literally closes up from snoring. After reading Hawaiian Airlines rules it clearly says rule number 8 cpap is a medical device and allowed to be used. It's a shame this ruined the whole experience of flying with Hawaiian airlines because all the rest of the staff was great. Paid the for the seats so I can use the cpap.",

Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that\u2019s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats\u2026 If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well\u2026 nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We\u2019ll it happens\u2026 Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- \u201cSo, what are the options now?\u201d. Answer now is \u201cYou\u2019ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning\u2026 what are my options? Answer was \u201cwell you can take the room and voucher or not\u2026 that\u2019s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we\u2019re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was \u201cfile a complaint\u201d. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse I\u2019ve had on an airplane, and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. I\u2019ve never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their in-cabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was god-awful. Remember\u2026 if this was my experience in first class, what would it be for folks in the other seats?",

The customer service rep told me the amount I had paid for said flight was just to \"place my flight on standby\" and the 2 seats I purchased were not actually confirmed. He said this may have been a computer glitch because this never happens or sometimes with HA this happens because people want to pay their taxes for the flight at the airport. This has never happened before with any other airline I have used. I received no notice that my flight was not confirmed, instead I received the opposite that my flights were confirmed. If I had not called I may have gone to the airport to find out there were no more available seats on the flight (customer service rep told me this). This is crazy. I paid another $100 something for taxes. At first I thought it was a scam, but realized that didn't make sense because they had the correct flight info and my info before I have it to them. So thank God it wasn't a scam, but risked almost missing 2 flights on my honeymoon because of a \"computer glitch\" or failure to contact me to let me know my flight was not confirmed. None of this makes any sense. Customer service rep was very nice and worked with me. But extremely frustrating and still do not understand how this happened",

Flight attendants on Hawaiian just watch as passengers take their time wondering which compartments they should pick.

I used all sorts of polite words when I asked him, so I didn't feel I had offended him in any way. But he reacted to me with extreme impatience. He even stopped, looked at me and let out a loud sigh. I told him I was sorry when he changed it for me. But then the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, because it wasn't my fault at all, and he had no reason to be impatient with a small request from a customer.

We were told by baggage claim services that we had to call the number we were given to talk to someone about what to do, but that our bags were most likely stuck in Seattle. After being on hold with the number they provided us for over an hour before even speaking to a single representative, we gave up with them. They eventually called us way later to inform us that our bags had been at the Honolulu Airport the whole time, but had been delivered to the wrong place. We finally got our bags back. On our flight back from Honolulu to Seattle, our flight with Hawaiian was so late that we missed our connecting flight. Hawaiian was so unhelpful and refused to cover any costs, accommodation, or anything. We couldn't afford a hotel and ended up having to sit at the Seattle airport for around 5 1/2 hours till family members were able to drive all the way to the Seattle airport to get us before we had to drive roughly three hours to our hometown. Such a ridiculously stressful experience, on top of which: my in-flight entertainment screen never worked on EITHER flight we had with them, there were zero vegetarian options for the free meal they provide for \"dinner\" (not everyone eats pork, Hawaiian!), and the stewardesses seemed incredibly inconvenienced by the simplest of requests.

        "Review": "  I just had a terrible experience with Hawaiian Airlines, after being their loyal customer for so long. My husband and I was offered multiple times a companion ticket discount of $100 but when I tried to use it online, it errored out, the website asked me to call their customer service and provided a phone number. I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they \"are aware of it\", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service. Not until the price they offered me is ~$200 extra per person than the web pricing! Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their \"earned discount\" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead! Yes, while they are claiming \"No change fee\" yet there is a $25 phone service charge upon anything you want to change, too! What a lying, cheating, blood-sucking company! They charge for every turn, every little thing including their mistakes, too (website error)! Stay away from this company, if you can! They are in blood-sucking mode right now!",

In order to enjoy a trip from Paradise home, one must pass through the gates of purgatory, which is another word for Hawaiian Airlines within the Daniel Inouye airport in Honolulu. For two seniors traveling with luggage, this was an excruciating experience. The three separate (and long) lines needing to endure just in order to check baggage was senseless. The walk from the main terminal to the gate to the departure area might as well have been from downtown Waikiki, which might have been more pleasant. And then there's the food onboard. Or more precisely, the absence of anything worthwhile to consume. Fortunately we learned our lesson on the outbound flight after going hungry for about eight hours. We packed a good lunch and snacks and were then able to bypass the airline's poor quality offerings.",

I used Hawaiian airlines for inter-island transfers and they were never on time, always late. I had a day trip to Maui and they started loading cargos after all passengers had completed boarding, thankfully it only took about 20 minutes or so. On 07/23/22, there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight. i planned a day trip to Kauai departing Honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm. however, because of the delay, now i have to cancel all booked activities. The airplane is still not departing (as of 7/23/22 8:40 am). One good thing about Hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent - they are very consistent in providing well below average service. They don't let you down when providing poor services. They are never sorry for anything. I have another upcoming island excursion to the big island. i hope not to get the same consistent service.",

Hawaiian Airlines has one of the very best cabin service in my opinion. Yet, their ticketing and customer service, which is farmed out to a 3rd world call center staffed by 5th world personnel, seems substandard compared to other airlines. Emptor Caveat. Buyer Beware. Behind that warm aloha spirit, they are still a money making machine first and foremost, customer service be damned.",

        "Review": "  We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs. Bottom line: Don't expect Delta Service on Hawaiian Airlines.",

We asked about upgrading to first class and was told we'd have to enter a bid. Sounded odd but this was the first time using this airline so not understanding. During the flight my seat was broken, reclined during take off and throughout the flight making it a very unsafe, uncomfortable and a frustrating flight. In additional to not having the seats we preferred, a seat that was broken, the stewardess had a open bottle of water with no cap and spilled water on my fianc\u00e9e as she was attempting to give her trash wetting her entire left side blouse. She apologized but this only added to frustration. Upon arriving to the destination, we immediately went to check-in to advise of the trip and inquire about either upgrading to Comfort Plus, First Class or cancelling return flight. Was advised we'd need to contact reservations. This is the first time using Hawaiian Airlines, the first leg of our trip and would never use again especially considering the fact that when we called, they provided no service and didn't bother to do anything to fix the problem or accommodate our return flight.

You can't do it yourself if it involves more than one city which is absurd. Changing a ticket booking because the airline canceled flight is a basic level of service that I should be able to do from my phone. If you are going to force me to have a representative to rebook my ticket then provide representatives that are available! I spent days waiting on phone lines and \"Live Chat\" rooms for such a simple task. If the tickets weren't so overpriced, I would of dumped the money and rebooked with another airline. I have no issues with the actual planes, flight attendants or workers of Hawaiian airlines but the company needs serious restructuring of its customer facing services.",

I am grateful for their mask and vaccine mandate as it made me feel safer since this is my first time traveling again since Feb of 2020. The trip back from Honolulu to LAX was good, but this time the food was disgusting. They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food. To Hawaiian Airlines: When you try too hard to give people the \"fru fru\" stuff you miss the ball altogether. Give us some meat with veggies and a vegan option and call it good. No need for the weird stuff. And you'll save some money by avoiding expensive disgusting ingredients too. Stick to the basics. A happy tummy is a happy customer.",

        "Review": "  Not really specific for the flight information provided above, but when I tried to travel the next time (tried to book / cancel). On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to. Worst customer experience calling them, never had a clean flight with them, plus they are usually more expensive than other airlines, so I'd highly highly recommend flying with some other airline.",

Announcements were made frequently regarding flight status and gate updates, really good. Boarding is quite organized and people were called to board by zones. The airplane for flight HA 216 was N488HA, a 23 years old B712. We opted for the over wing emergency exit with extra legroom. The seats are very standard plastic backed type and at the emergency exit the tray tables were located in the armrest. However since the trip only takes minutes we don't really have the need for the tray table. We only bring our backpacks for the flight and were able to put them under the seat in front of us. The overhead bins are on the small side, and based on its size can accommodate slimmer carryon only. We depart around 15 minutes later than schedule (which is a big deal for the 20-30 minutes inter island flights like these) however we land around 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight attendants were all very nice and cheerful, and within a short 20-25 minutes flight were able to serve us drink (water or a delicious POG juice cocktail - Passion fruit-Orange-Guava) and collect all the trash within minutes, and we are ready for landing.",

        "Review": " We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used \"Partner\" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to \"call\", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, \"we're not Delta Airlines.\" I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, \"as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there?\" His response, \"more money.\" I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us. Rather than have us keep calling their toll-free and never getting through, one of their agents could have called us (same amount of time on the phone for their agents). We paid a premium for everything on this trip, costs were about 30% higher than in the past. We knew that going in. The cost of more than a half-day of lost vacation time and toll of having your itinerary cancelled mid-trip - priceless.",

This is my 3rd time flying with Jet Blue and this is the 3rd time I\u2019ve experience incompetence with them. Our flight is delayed because of some mysterious storm that I can\u2019t seem to find anywhere on the radar. We were supposed to fly out 9PM last night and it\u2019s currently 12:41 PM 7/22/23. The flight time has changed around 10 times now and was just delayed again to 1:30PM today. I TOLD my boyfriend not to fly with them again, but No. The last time we flew with them, the pilot never even showed up for work and they had to bring a pilot from another airport. Now this flight has been delayed \u201cdue to weather\u201d (which is all they can say) and late last night they changed the time to 3 AM from 12:30 PM. If this is due to weather, how can you just push the time up roughly 9 hours? And then push it to 1:30 pm, and then 12:30 and then 1:30 again? This is by far the worst airline in the world and they have THE NERVE to try to buy another airline. Get your business in order first before you try ruining Spirit Airlines (which I assume HAS to be 500x better than this trash airline). At least this time it wasn\u2019t 10 degrees on the flight, though the Wi-Fi didn\u2019t work. There were no apologies or anything. Also, every flight from every other airline that was heading to New York from San Francisco (which is very close to San Jose, you can see that airport when you\u2019re taking off) that night we\u2019re all fly out on time, no delays or anything. There was no bad weather or anything. Just JetBlue lying to keep from having to give refunds or something to everybody.",

My trip on July 23rd to Tampa is delayed from 10:18 to 2:40 as they are waiting for a plane from the Dominican republic to arrive. A four hour delay is now common on Jet Blue flights along with cancelations. The email they sent me says it is a 22hr flight to Tampa and the help desk doesn't know why it says that so you have to literally go to the help desk to get information.

I tried a new flight and it's delayed as well. There should be a policy that if a flight is delayed for than three times that it should be canceled. The customer service is horrible in the Santo Domingo airport in Jetblue. You can wait on a line for an hour or more and they don't help anyone or communicate what's happening to the plane. The Jetblue workers in Santo Domingo have attitudes and don't wanna do their job. Jetblue will delay everything and not compensate you when you lose days of work.

Turns out, it wasn't just ours; on the board of flights, over 15 other flights were heavily delayed and canceled. We were all told at once about the cancelation, so we all ran against one another to get in line first, which has barely moved as I write this (over an hour wait now). There was an automatic rebooking, which would take us up to New York (which is being hit by heavy storms), then back down to Florida, then finally to California which makes 0 sense. Employees have said all their hotels are booked and no direct flights can come until 2 days, so overall we are stranded in another state with nothing and no compensation.

They cancel that flight and rebook us from DC going to West Palm. Even though they are still selling flights from DC to FLL and had enough space to book all 4 of us for any of the FLL flights. We find this out as we arrive to the airport. We were notified via voice message 4hrs later. After 2hrs wait to speak to an agent we were told they \"can send us to any South Florida airport they want\" and other passengers (even those without tickets previously) have priority. This is simply a money grab so they can continue selling flights and fill up the low demand flights to other locations. Arriving into West Palm, 70+ miles from our airport, at 9pm, with 2 small children after 72hrs of traveling is acceptable to Jetblue and a true representation of how little they value their customers.

After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a \"courtesy\". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me. This is about a company following through with what it promises its customers. After sharing this story with a friend, they explained that they had a similar experience with Jet Blue. Maybe its Jet Blues policy to lie to its customers. As a result of this, my family will never travel with JetBlue again. I would rather pay more to fly with a different airline than to give them our business again.",

        "Review": " I bought a JetBlue return ticket with 50 lbs of check-in baggage to travel from Atlanta and Boston from June 05 to June 10, 2023. I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn\u2019t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn\u2019t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel? As a graduate student, $250 is a huge amount for me.",

They didn\u2019t. They removed the flight from my app so I couldn\u2019t manage it. I finally got on a new flight on July 12 (3 days later) after spending literally 4 hours trying to reschedule and losing money for a hotel and time share points. In addition I had to pay a car service to get home. Then they sent an email saying the cancellation was out of their control and they didn\u2019t have to reimburse any of my expenses.

We even flew directly over JFK enroute to Boston Logan. Jet Blue\u2019s agents were inconsiderate and not customer friendly or helpful service. They rebooked our flight for a day later with entirely different airline flying to Madrid then back to Azores a day late. This cut the time in Azores plus defeated the purpose of stopping in Azores for a shorter trip to Europe. Will never again Fly with JetBlue or recommend them to anyone. Another thing before taking off from Tampa the restrooms in the plane were nasty. I guess it just shows how poor an airline Jet Blue is based on my experience. To address finger pointing they blame the cancellation on weather. It wasn\u2019t even raining or bad weather. We flew directly over JFK to Boston.",

I called Jetblue and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure I flew back home on June 22nd. The customer service rep was so concerned for me she got her supervisor online to help out. My flight was great. I used to be a 20 plus year Southwest Airlines frequent flyer, but due to the cancellation of direct flights from Providence RI to FT Lauderdale Florida I ditched them and have now been a loyal member of Jetblue for the last 2 years. As a frequent flyer of 12 flights per year I also have had a few delays, but were very far inbetween. I noticed that most of the complaints came from casual or vacation planers who are already under an incredible amount of anxiety and stress that comes along with travel. One of the best things for me about Jetblue is the InFlight entertainment that is in each seat rest. Otherwise the flight would be very boring.The snacks and drink selection is always great and the flight attendants are always helpful with whatever you need. As you read reviews that are negative please take into account these people are not regular travelers and expect everything to be perfect in this very time consuming and messed up world we all live in.",

        "Review": "  I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects. I hope JetBlue takes this feedback constructively and focuses on improving their operational efficiency to ensure a more reliable and customer-centric service in the future.",

My return flight switched from getting me home on a Sunday to a redeye arriving home on a Monday. Just didn't fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than I had booked. JetBlue allows you one change however they had NO FLIGHTS nonstop going to and from my destination. I called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst. They would refund my money but they would only put the money in a JetBlue bank that I could use one for one year. I didn't think this was fair since they made the change and now I was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me. I didn't want to leave money in a bank that I had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me. I had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip. Just what I was trying to avoid. I feel like Jet Blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight. Spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy. Whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy. Not so in this Airlines.

Since the reason for the cancellation was not a Forced Majeure Event, we should be allowed compensation. It is unacceptable. Our return flight was delayed twice as well. No reason given. We were pushed to the last row of the plane (since it was rebooked due to the original cancellation and we didn't get seats until we arrived) where the stewards were very loudly banging several times throughout the flight startling me and waking up the screaming infant after she finally fell asleep (several times). This was the worst experience I have ever had and we fly regularly. We will never use Jet Blue again.",

They updated it with a further delay until 10:10. Around 9:30 they announced the flight was cancelled. Of course, everyone rushed to the jetblue ticket counter. It was chaos. They began announcing and continued to repeat the announcement that they could not get anyone on a flight to the northeast until Friday (this was Monday). They repeatedly announced that if you wanted to reschedule (not before Friday), you should wait in line at the ticket counter. If you wanted a REFUND, don't wait in line and call jetblue. I chose the latter. A few days later, I phoned jetblue. The agent said there would be no refund, but as a courtesy he would give me a travel credit. I recently checked the travel credits and it's not there. I contacted jetblue. The agent said she has no record of the credit and, anyway, there is no credit for flights canceled due to weather. So, the agents making the announcement at the FLL airport were lying when they said we could get a refund. The agent who said he would give me a travel credit lied too. ",

        "Review": "  My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was \"overbooked,\" so they were going to have to \"rebook\" or \"cancel.\" She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her \"notes\" that my wife and I were \"late\" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer \"service\" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer \"service\" representatives.  We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded; we're still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlue's \"policy.\" ",

        "Review": " On June 16th, my husband and I were set to fly out of Cancun at noon. We received notification that the flight was delayed, but the email also said they were working to resolve it and to come to the airport on time anyway. Long story short, we spend over 12 hours waiting as our flight kept getting delayed. I attempted to contact customer service several times but received no update or information. In fact, the customer service chat was very rude. In the end, at the very last minute, our flight was canceled with no information. We were automatically booked on the next flight out the following day. The biggest problem with this story is that I was personally hosting a baby shower for my best friend on the 17th. JetBlue gave us no opportunity to rebook the flight, (and they ADMITTED they knew it was going to be canceled early in the day), nor did they allow us to cancel on our own to reschedule through a different airline. So 4 months of planning a baby shower and a lot of money spent, they had nothing to offer me. I've cried several times over this. To top it off, my husband and I stayed at a highly nice resort, The Excellence, during our vacation, and JetBlue put us up in a motel in Cancun that was not even 1% comparable, and to be honest, a little scary with no security. They also offered us \"dinner\" - a four-plate buffet of stale food at 11:00 p.m. at night. It was absolutely AWFUL. In the end, on the day of our departure (the 17th) we both received an apology email clearly stating that THEY screwed up and it was an \"avoidable cancellation.\" They then went on to offer a $100 credit to each of us. $100! What does that even get us? We don't get our time back, let alone enough credit to take another flight! We spent hours at an airport and spending money on food. $100 doesn't nearly cover it. Last night wrote a long email to the executives that I could find, and the response that I received was \"Too bad, you only get $100.\" I have never in my life had such a worse travel experience nor received the most awful response from customer service.",

        "Review": "  We tried to fly home from New York JFK to Albuquerque on Jet Blue Flight #0065 on Friday, June 2, but it turned out to be a total customer service nightmare. We sat on the runway for 2 hours waiting on a \u201cweather delay\u201d while watching other airlines take off and land. After the initial \u201cweather delay\u201d announcement, the flight crew and attendants were non-responsive to our passenger questions and would not provide any further updates on when we would be taking off. After this 2-hour delay, it was announced that we were returning to the gate because the flight crew could not exceed their \u201cflight time hours\u201d. While waiting for an additional 2 hours for a new flight crew to show up but never did, the gate staff were very dismissive and would not provide any updates on our flight departure. We also never received any e-mail or text updates from JetBlue like we did before the flight. After watching our luggage being unloaded from the plane, the gate staff finally admitted that the flight was canceled. After being told to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and to report to a ticketing office to be booked on JetBlue Flight #0066 or on another flight the next morning, we and the other 200+ passengers waited for another 2 hours in a long line while being chastised by ticketing staff to be more patient! After noticing that Flight #0066 was canceled without explanation and after being informed by other passengers that new tickets or hotel accommodations were not being issued by the ticketing staff, it became clear to us that customer service is not a priority for Jetblue so we decided to buy tickets on Delta Airlines at a considerable cost for our return flight home. This was our first and last flight on JetBlue. We will never fly JetBlue ever again.",

JB changed my flight to a 12:30 flight that got me to NY at 2:45, middle of the rush hour. 3 hour drive in heavy traffic to CT. RETURN FLIGHT June 7. Flight 2339 Flight delayed 3 1/2 hours as they used our aircraft for a fully booked flight to Tampa, our Jacksonville flight was about 60% populated. The cabin crew or dispatcher or whomever is responsible for catering the aircraft failed to notify the caterer of the new time, gate etc whatever is needed for the caterer to know where to meet the aircraft. Many passengers were aware of the aircraft switch off and voiced their disapproval of this move. I heard many folks like myself resolve to never fly Jet Blue again. The crew did a very nice job of taking care of us however they could not offer hit coffee or tea as the plane was not catered, Jet Blue offered us a 50$ credit which is nonuse to me as i will never use this airline again. This is the third time JB has botched my flights from or to NY where I travel on a monthly basis. On one JB flight that was cancelled I booked a Delta flight home from JFK after getting a cab from LGA so i would not have to wait 36 hrs for a connecting flight thru Boston to get home to Jacksonville flying Jet Blue. This cost me 559$. No more Jet Blue, they really do not manage the company as though they care about the passenger. ",

Their excuse was inclement weather in the northeast but as it turns out (as I happened to overhear from two airport staff guys later that day), flight crews had refused to work our flight back to NY. Two hours after we were originally supposed to depart, they canceled our flight with no real explanation. I scrambled to rebook another flight home and our only option was a flight on American to NJ instead of NY. I booked it though the app, ended up paying for our seats, and though we finally made it back, my grief wasn't over. I have been trying to claim miles/points for that flight for us since and repeatedly that request was denied! Jetblue lies about how to get your miles/points. You can request them all you want but you'll never get them. I'm going to stop flying JetBlue. I'll fly with a carrier that actually cares about their customers.

Moreover, when I called to reschedule my return trip, I encountered a similar lack of empathy and was informed that one flight's cancellation had no impact on the booking of another. To make matters worse, there were no options provided to speak to a supervisor, despite being told that I was already speaking to one who displayed the same rudeness and lack of understanding. Overall, while I used to consider Jetblue a reliable airline, this experience has significantly diminished my confidence in them. From now on, they will not be my top choice for air travel.",

I chatted with them again today and there's nothing they can do, so now I have had to pay for my flights, seats, and baggage for eachflight (4 total at $35 each flight for just my one check bag and $30 for my seats each way) 3 days before my already expensive vacation.

However, Jet Blue never sent a rep to inform people of the issue, how it was being resolved or how long it would take.

There were three women sitting there. Not one of them wandered out of their office to explain to everyone at the airport waiting for luggage what the problem was. When I asked she said \"I just spoke with them. They're working on it.\" The lack of concern and professionalism was very disappointing. One passenger said her husband got an $80 ticket waiting for her. My friends waited over 2 hours in the cell phone lot - one of them is in a wheelchair.

I booked a honeymoon flight for my wife and I back in 2021, which we could not take because of covid restrictions. We were issued travel credits (that expire for no apparent reason) instead of a refund. Now we had to scramble to find the time and money to take a vacation within their expiry period during a global pandemic. We tried to book a flight for a shorter vacation, but the schedule would not work out for us so we would have to postpone by canceling that next flight. They gave us a hard time for even doing that like we were trying to find some loophole to buy more time (but why do these even expire?). Then we could finally cancel it and receive MOST of our credit back and they sent an email saying the credit will be valid until it expires (1 year per their policy), but they did not list the date on the email. I tried to go back and book a summer vacation using point I knew I had and saw those points expired THE DAY AFTER THE REFUND. I called to ask them to reinstall that credit since there was no warning and customer service hung up on me. I called back and someone at the escalation department was saying it was my fault for not being responsible with the credit! The gall on these people trying to gaslight and steal from me! Then when I asked how could this corporation have the heart to do this to someone who saved their hard earned money for their honeymoon that was shafted by the pandemic, they hung up on me again. Jetblue is making my blood boil! I tried citing them to the BBB but they sent some pre-generated response about the BBB not having jurisdiction over them because of the Airline Deregulation Act. ",

I followed instructions to switch flights online, and when I did so, found that the next flight to Fort Myers was 2 days out. To travel the same day, I was forced to take a flight to nearby Tampa, FL instead. I was charged an additional $320 to do this. However, in the \"Flights Cancelled by JetBlue\" section of the \"Delays, Cancellations, and Schedule Changes\" page on the website (https://www.jetblue.com/help/delays-and-cancellations), it states that I should be able to switch to another flight at no charge if JetBlue cancelled. I contacted them through their website to request a refund, which was denied on the grounds that they claim that I willfully elected to fly to a different city - this is a completely ridiculous claim, since they cancelled the flight, and the next flight to the same city was multiple days out. No other flights were cancelled or delayed at all that day, indicating no staffing issues. There was no inclement weather on either end. This implies that they must have cancelled because not enough people were on the flight, so it was no longer profitable. It's concerning that US-based airlines are allowed to do this with flights at the last possible minute. As if JetBlue hasn't already jerked me around enough: 5 weeks after the flight, I got an email from them saying I was \"undercharged\" for services offered, and they're going to charge me even more this coming week. It was aggravating enough to be refused a refund, but beyond ridiculous to be charged even more well over a month after the cancelled flight. Beginning to enter scam-like territory.",

While I understand that times have been tough for many, JetBlue is the only company I interact with where its employees consistently have blatant attitude problems and clearly don't care about its customers. I\u2019m a laid-back person and can deal with lost bags, delayed flights, and less-than-ideal hubs, but when it\u2019s employees consistently seem angry and look down upon their clients, I cannot help but use another service. During my last trip, there was a system malfunction that swapped my flight out and upon calling the service, they were beyond unreasonable in lending assistance for an issue that was their fault in the first place. Another experience that has left me feeling disrespected and disappointed. I am officially done with JetBlue. I hope this serves as a warning to others who may be considering their services. Stick with Delta, Southwest, American, or even discount airlines such as Spirit or Frontier \u2013 the staff is friendlier and helpful and their planes are fine if not better for many flights.

My husband and I were also scheduled to board a cruise ship in Miami, which we scheduled ground transportation from the FLL airport. We had to be on board the ship no later than 3:00 pm. The flight was first delayed to leave at 10:31 am, which caused concern for us as time would be cutting it close but we decided to not panic. This was announced at around 8:30 am. Not even 1 hour after the first delay, it was announced that we were delayed again to leave at 12:30pm! Meanwhile, at the gate next to us, 2 aircrafts scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fl (1 left at approximately 9 and the other boarding at approximately 11) seemed to have no problem. The desk attendants finally let us know that the aircraft was having mechanical issues and that they were working on it. We tried to get on another flight but were told that we would not be able to get our luggage and that West Palm Beach was more than an hour away from Miami. We had to contact the transportation/cruise line to cancel our trip. This was extremely disappointing and heartbreaking. We had planned for months to have a vacation and JetBlue ruined our experience. We found out that the flight was again delayed to 1:30 and subsequently, it left at 2:21, arriving at FLL at 5:08 pm! JetBlue could have announced that there were mechanical issues from the start and offered us optional flights at 8:55. Having a flight credit and adding 100.00 to our account could not and would not replace the memories stolen from us.

The check-in process was ok but once on board, we were greeted by an extremely rude and full of attitude airhostess. We were a family of four with two babies. We had to take the long ramp up the flight and I had foldable overhead stroller which one of babies was sitting in. The air hostess kept taunting and making comments on how I should have folded my stroller before boarding. She refused to help with my stuff. She threw my jackets on the floor. After that she started complaining about our carry on and that we should have checked that in as well. They told us they were upgrading us at the check in counter and charged us $500 but there is no business class on Jetblue, its all the same seats. The seats were uncomfortable and cramped, with no room to move or stretch out. Both air hostess gave us attitude till we got off. We were already stressed out as kids were not feeling well. We were treated horribly. We traveled to Punta CAna from NY on American Airlines and such a wonderful experience and service from everyone. Unfortunately, we had to take Jetblue back due to a family emergency but the flight attendants made sure we were treated badly. Overall, I would not recommend flying with Jetblue to anyone.

Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad. They took zero responsibility, and very rudely said they wouldn't do anything for us, even after being very calm with them. Pathetic airline.

I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working. It is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at Barbados) I'm not angry at the people at the boarding desk because I do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until I had this particular document which I could not get at all because the site is not working. A nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so I could board the plane. I was livid and so upset that I was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary! Truly the immigration officer at Barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane (coming from the US) was able to fill out their form at customs. They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane. The first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell. They kept the lights on the entire time, and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbow/tray at least 20 times. They were angry. 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes. A flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back, yank her hood off and tell her to\"wake up. They then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land. On my next flight to Barbados, no one asked for this stupid entry form when I was boarding which I thought was super comical. I was in a middle seat and when I sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around. Flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and I'm like don't know. Finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down, I was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because it's really hard for me to get up and down (come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury). Flight attendants were so rude to her. I had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when I asked for water. I asked one male attendant who never brought it to me & when I asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water, she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesn't give me a sparkling water and just walks away.

One flight was canceled on a Monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport. That also means that the people in Las Vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort Lauderdale because the flight never gets to Las Vegas! The ripple effects are disastrous JetBlue also has four local flights such as fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville and Jacksonville back to the fort Lauderdale and fort Lauderdale to Cuba and Cuba back to fort Lauderdale (flight number 17, 18 1499 and 1500) and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since April 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain. But even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled About a year ago Jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case.

They got confused there was two flights leaving to JFK, we were given the wrong gate number so the lady told us we would have to wait, only 2 seats available only our flight but figure we have 6 tickets. I purchased my infant a seat and had no choice but to fly with my infant and 5 year old. My husband had to wait and get on the next flight with my 8 year old and 9 year old. When we asked why we don\u2019t have seats we were told they had to give our seats to flight attendants so why not notify us prior. JetBlue broke my stroller and all they gave me was a credit for my infant seat, disgusting.",

I was told by the JetBlue customer representative that I would be reimbursed for my hotel stay.

I have never in my life had such a horrible experience with an airline. Imagine traveling with a screaming 2 year old and 3 year old. They gave me $50 credit as if that would sufficiently compensate for the entire suffering. We had to stay at a terrible airport hotel down the street which cost a fortune due to being last minute and JetBlue absolutely refuses to reimburse me for it.

Also, though this has nothing to do with the airline, the person in front of me has chosen to recline their seat. Why was this even made an option? And who would do that?

        "Review": "  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an \"A\" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble. They get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing!",

Light passenger load to San Jose so room to move around. Usual beverage and snack service. Quick stop in San Jose was lengthened to an extra 30 minutes as waiting for arriving passengers to board from another flight. it was understandable as it was about 20 passengers. Still a light load with only half the seats filled onwards to LA. Another beverage and snack service. Arrived into Los Angeles about half an hour late. From landing to driving out of the airport was only 20 minutes so made up time that way. All in all a good experience with pleasant flight and ground crew.

I thought Southwest was genuinely trying to make things right with travelers by offering 25,000 reward points, When I went to redeem the points, I was shocked to learn that they had expired because I did not redeem them by March 31, 2023. If the points are not supposed to expire, why have a deadline to redeem the points? This tactic solidified my initial gut feeling about Southwest. I will never fly them again!",

Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fianc\u00e9 as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fianc\u00e9's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fianc\u00e9 was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit na\u00efve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fianc\u00e9 right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay. I know I was a bit na\u00efve but I still feel scammed out of my honeymoon. Please be careful trusting any deal Southwest Airlines promotes because there's probably a catch somewhere.",

        "Review": "  I fly Southwest every 3 weeks from Denver to Albuquerque on business. The last 8 times the return trip from ABQ to DEN has been delayed or cancelled. Southwest uses every excuse in the book, mostly weather related. These are lies. One flight, where we were 5 hours late getting into Denver, the captain blamed a tornado near DIA. The groundspout (basically a whirlwind) happened at 4:30pm and was 15 miles from DIA. We landed in Denver at about 1:30AM the next morning. Nothing but lies! Last night we were running about 1 hour late (as usual!) When we arrived at the gate we sat in the plane for 10 minutes while the gate agent chewed the fat with a friend ( in her case it was alot of chewing!) and then decided to wadle down the jetway and unlock us. After all why hurry for 120 people waiting in a plane. Unfortunately Southwest and United are the only airlines offering nonstop service between ABQ and DEN. I have been a loyal customer of Southwest for over 20 years and have accumulated several hundred thousand Rapid Rewards miles which I have used. No More! Bye Bye Southwest!",

For verification I asked an off duty Flight Attendant what gate we were to fly out of. She looked at my ticket and told me C25 and pointed. We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that \"there's a woman and two children running your way.\" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, \"Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked.\" I was frantic. When we got there the gal taking the ticket asked me how I felt and that I was blue around my mouth and she needed me to get stabilized with oxygen before she would let me on the plane. I received oxygen for about 10 - 15 minutes then boarded. Two flight attendants not only held the plane for me but saved me 3 seats together in the back of the plane. I've only flown Southwest except for one time with Frontier. I will always fly Southwest. I love Southwest and their cancellation policy, baggage perks and loyalty points with my membership. Thank you to the flight attendants for helping me in this pinch. You were so compassionate and helpful, above and beyond the call of duty. You are assets to Southwest. Thank you to the Pilot and other crew members. I hope I didn't cause anyone to miss a connecting flight as we were delayed.",

        "Review": "  Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning. To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding. Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again. What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business. To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction.",

        "Review": "  I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was \"on the way\". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, \"why don't you just walk?\" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she \"worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers\". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline. Also, when the person behind the desk told me \"to just walk to the gate\", it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me.",

I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50). I will remember the lack of concern from Southwest me and my company employees fly in the future.",

From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline. Southwest Airlines has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I can confidently say that I will not be choosing them for any future flights.",

But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.\u00a0 An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).\u00a0 On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they \"cancel\" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this \"freebie\" service in the name of supposed \"turbulence\" despite a relatively smooth flight.\u00a0 I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like \"let me find out\".\u00a0 \u00a0A few minutes later, the captain came on and \"explained\" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.\u00a0 When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me \"were not going to do that\" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would \"divert the plane\"  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.\u00a0 I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.\u00a0 Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to \"hide\" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.\u00a0 So this is all being done in the name of \"safety\" - lets go with that. ",

I had no idea where \u201cC\u201d was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow \u201cC\u201d woman who moved around, so I followed her. She said that since \u201cA loaded, C could now line up.\u201d It was then I figured out what the other number was on my ticket- so I lined up in that spot that was on a sign. As I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant how I get a seat, \u201cyou just chose anything open.\u201d I had no idea. And I had checked my boarding pass and even \u201cpre-boarded.\u201d How did I miss this information? It truly was a cattle call boarding experience. Luckily there were some very nice people to help me along in the boarding process as to where to go. What a joke. What has happened to public transportation?",

Well, I am not lucky in cards - so my flight got cancelled just because. No inclement weather, no real reason. Just the fact that Southwest is incapable of doing their job of scheduling and has no care for their passengers time nor plans. So what they refunded the money? That\u2019s not what I was looking for - I was looking to see my friend and make memories. But their rebooking is just ridiculous. Delaying my weekend trip until Saturday night, no other options, no other compensation. They are professional at cancelling flights without a second thought and then basically insulting you with their rebooking. I will never book Southwest again, I would rather invest in a reliable airline to actually get to my destination.

I flew 11 May 2023 from BWI to Tulsa through St. Louis and I paid for Business Select so I could be in the first boarding group. When I checked in I was A01, which would mean I could get to my choice seat early and get my bag in an overhead bin. Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left. Sad thing is, many were able to walk to bathroom, get their luggage in and out of the overheads without issue. Southwest needs to recognize those who pay extra for their seats choice and have anyone who wants to pre board be required to sit in the back of the plane.",

Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she \"refused to serve me any longer\" which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person, I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her. I am distraught as a whole at the incredibly poor showing Southwest is giving me during my travel toward my honeymoon with my wife who lives apart from me due to our work as physicians.",

I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever. So......maybe it's time to think about what is actually fair in this awful situation that you created?",

I found a wheelchair and walked pushing the wheelchair towards my connecting gate which was at the farthest end of the airport last gate.

I did not complain about what happened (no one for me there at the gate) but I thought I better call and make sure that doesn't happen again.

While waiting, one of the attendants, took out his guitar and played a couple of songs, to pass the time. It was wonderful. Not only did it make the time go by faster, but he had a really good voice. I had been seated next to a young college girl, who apparently didn't like his singing. She said aloud so that I could hear her, that she was going to notify the airline that she was offended, and that he needed to work somewhere else. She was giggling at that time. She got on her phone and started to look up the airline to notify them. When the attendant stopped singing; I clapped really loud (along with many others) so that she would know that I did like it, and appreciated him putting himself out there, like that. His songs were country music and nothing in them could have been considered offensive to anyone, that I could imagine. I just wanted to let everyone know how ridiculous this young girls behavior was, just in case she did actually do as she said, and try to make him lose his job. He actually made the flight much better.",

I am a 61 year old woman who was waiting to have a knee replacement surgery. I do not feel that my comment would somehow put anyone in danger. The agent did not like my comment and she decided to use her power to punish me. I will never forget this as long as I live. I will not forget the way this made me feel and what I missed that was caused by her using the power of the FAA giving airline employees the right to treat passengers any way they want. I try to avoid flying on Southwest Airlines, the employees have become increasingly rude on the ground.

The only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding. I was forced to more than halfway back in the plane. If these people are continuing on, they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate. Southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege. In flight wifi/entertainment was not working and there are no charging ports or receptacles to charge devices. This was my first experience with the airline and I plan on it being the last.

        "Review": "\u00a0What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're in the air to Tampa, citing \"weather\". After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% of other airlines were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were. We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And they weren't canceled! We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn\u2019t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport. I don\u2019t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my \u201cgo-to\u201d airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline\u2019s inconsistency with flights). If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their \u201ccustomary playbook\u201d profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: \"Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver.\" Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way? Shame on you Southwest!",

        "Review": " I had SWA tickets from ONT to ATL with a connection in Dallas. Southwest clearly lost control of their operation on 1/30-31 and stranded me in Vegas. Ok, there was ice in Dallas, but I would have been happy to keep my hotel room and car another day to avoid being stranded. They kept telling me to come to the airport as they had rescheduled my flight. Instead they cancelled my flight FIVE times and promised me each time that I could reach my destination on time. I asked if there was any chance of missing my connection and SW said no. I think they were fabricating stories because they got me to give up my hotel room, rental car. One time in ONT they pushed off from the gate and rode around on the runway and then parked right back at the gate. It was hot in the plane and full of fumes. I got sick on the plane. Once parked again I got off the plane and tried to talk to some one, ANYONE, who could help but there was just one ticket person and a long line of angry customers. I never was able to schedule another connection in Ontario. At one point they said they would take my luggage off the plane and then said they wouldnt. So I got back on the plane prefering to be stranded with luggage rather than without. These Southwest people are rude and crude and have no idea what they are telling people! Why do they feel they have to tell people things that aren't true? Is it just some power trip and they enjoy wrecking the plans of their customers? Anyhow, I eventually landed in Vegas and once again there was no one who knew what was going on. No one could tell me how to get home to Atlanta. I had a boarding pass for the flight to Atlanta but when I tried to use it they said the boarding pass was no good. Some SWA jerk grabbed it out of my hands and said \"Hmm, it says it's for Atlanta\". Anyhow, they told me to go talk to customer service so I lost my seating assignment. At \"customer service\" they printed out another ticket and said to go get on the plane. I tried and again the boarding pass was not working. The whole time they were acting as if this was my fault, even though it was their obvious flawed way of doing things. Any airline this bad should not be allowed to fly. They are completely unsympathetic. Just rude and nasty if you express simple concerns about your schedule or luggage. In one breath they blame it on flight control, tell you what flight to get on, and then it all turns out to be bogus information. Keep in mind that Southwest perpetuated this mess over three days. Maybe somewhere someone was working on it but you could have fooled me. They looked like idiots and no one had any confidence in what they were saying. Southwest made a lot of people desperate for no reason. Ok, there was ice in Dallas but Southwest made the situation 10 times worse by telling people their flights were still taking off and convincing people to come to the airport. This made some people a bit panicky for no reason other than a few airline people wanting to look like they had all the answers. In fact their systems were failing, their people were confused and untrained, and they reacted rudely and aggressively.",

This turned out trip into a 10+ hour trip. This inconvenienced my family greatly. Also, I traveled with military personnel who is family my entire trip and had no issues anywhere else except for when staff at Gate 41 refused to allow us back with our group. We traveled as a group of 4, he scanned 2 of our passes and refused to scan the other 2 and sent us to the end of the line ultimately separating us and causing issues with our seating. This staff was not pleasant and did not allow our military personnel guest use her benefits properly even after we already spent 6 hours in the USO after once again being inconvenienced.

        "Review": "  My wife and I have been traveling on Southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways. In fact we just had a trip through Southwest Vacations that was fantastic. Our latest experience with them, however, has been both eye-opening and frustrating. We had booked flights for February 2nd from Puerto Vallarta to Reno with a connection in Phoenix. We had flight 1299 from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix and then flight 547 from Phoenix to Reno. We received an email from Southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from Puerto Vallarta to Denver and then Denver to Reno. We had seen this Denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from Mexico to Denver in the dead of the winter. Too much of a chance of being stuck in Mexico. I went on the Southwest website and could see that our original flights through Phoenix and on to Reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights. I called Southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights. The customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix but informed us (here\u2019s where things got wonky) that we could no longer choose our original Phoenix to Reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer \u2018linked\u2019 in their system. I asked her what she meant by that. Apparently, Southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from A to B with a connection in between it will only show you these \u2018linked\u2019 flights. There may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system. So our original flights were \u2018linked\u2019 when we booked them but were then \u2018unlinked\u2019 and changed by Southwest to Denver. And when I tried to change them back I was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked. The only \u2018linked\u2019 flight through Phoenix was a 5-hour and 20 minute layover in Phoenix and then a flight stopping in Vegas and traveling on to Reno. I pointed out to Southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through Vegas and on to Reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover. I was told that was not an option because that was not a \u2018linked\u2019 flight. Seriously! You changed our flights! You un-linked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with. C\u2019mon Southwest you can do better. At the end of most flights the flight attendant will say \"We know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying Southwest.\" And so my wife and I will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if it's time to exercise that choice.

I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated. I deserve respect and for SW to keep their word.  I'm tired of being told no one will do anything for me. I have flown SW for 15yrs with no problems until recently when it been nothing but awful and I'm considering switching airlines from now on.",

I would have to call their customer service line. I have tried calling, been unsuccessful have been on hold and disconnected six times in total have spent 30 hours on hold. Just trying to get a refund for a flight that this airline themselves canceled. Reason for cancellation was not leather related. It was due to the fact that Southwest agents overbooked flights that they had no crew to fly. I will never in my life flying Southwest again three times I have flown Southwest I have had issues every time. This is an absolutely horrible, horrible airline.

Our Flight was delayed multiple times, during that time I was able to do some research as to what was going on. Due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights. Southwest included. I understand people being upset, but what I appreciate is Southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the Airline and Flights were experiencing \"Irregular Operations\", they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time: \"If your flight was canceled and you would like a refund, please submit a request\". So I went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled. Of course multiple delays, the ground crew communicated with us multiple times, telling us they were doing what they could, that something had happened to their network. could have it been hacked? or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity? Regardless, this airline wouldn't have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe, or they had the capacity. Then to our amazement they were able to organize the crew offline and get us on our flight home. These are trying times, shutdowns due to mysterious viruses, freaky weather. Some things can't always be controlled or predicted, but the response is what matters. Southwest is doing a great job despite the circumstances and I will continue to fly with this airline!!",

Tomorrow comes, same thing happens. They delay our flight 3x once again. After that, I knew they were bound to cancel at the last minute once again. So, I left to go home without even rebooking. I checked my email and \"surprise\", they cancelled it last minute before boarding. I feel bad for the passengers who had hope and stayed waiting all night. Thanks Southwest for ruining my family's Christmas and thousands of other's as well. I guess if I want to visit my family on holidays, I'll remember to never book Southwest. Truly unacceptable and unforgivable. I'm 100% paying more to fly Delta now. Learned my lesson. I forgot to mention they sent all our luggage without us. So my clothes, toiletry, belongings, and necessities are halfway across the country from me. ",

They lost my luggage, I never received my luggage I was wearing the same clothes for 4 days only to catch a flight home, and on the change over, still no employees.

We should\u2019ve been off at 4:25 but they\u2019re so understaffed that they didn\u2019t even have flight attendants, luckily 3 women jumped in and took the job. As we\u2019ve sat on this aircraft for more than 40 mins while they try to gather other passengers. We don\u2019t get discounted tickets or anything for this wait. And yet this is just supposed to be ok. We should\u2019ve landed a hour ago. All to fill seats. They flight was already full. So we\u2019ve have to wait, for 3 passengers. No thanks Southwest.

        "Review": "  On Saturday 12/24 I was at the airport by 10:15 for my 12:15 boarding of Flt 2909 to Manchester. I'm always early. It was delayed to 1:45 then cancelled by 11:30. Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting! How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect. I finally rebooked & now for the last time I'm going to try to get to Manchester on 12/28. Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them? Also by the time my bags get to Manchester, if, in fact, they do find them, I will either be in NY or back in Tampa. The only warm clothes I own are in one of those bags. He said there was nothing he could do to help.",

SpiceJet did not send any SMS/email for reschedule. When I reached Airport at 1750hrs (85 min before), Security Staff at Airport didn't allowed me to enter as I couldn't show any SMS/email of reschedule. At 1825 I could enter and rushed to Spice Jet counter but they didn't allow to board the flight. When I shown my defence Id and informed that I am on official operational duties. They insulted me and still didn't allow to board the flight. One of the worst flights SpiceJet",

We had an onwards journey to Shillong. When we tried to check in, we realised that flight has changed to evening 19.00 hrs. To avoid losing a day in Shillong, we had to book a day prior and had to book a stay in Guwahati. Spent around 20k more. This flight was delayed by 30 min. On our return journey, we had a ticket from Guwahati for 17.10 hrs on 21st May 2023. Reaching Mumbai back at 20.30 hrs same day. While we tried checking in previous day, we learnt that flight time has changed to 23.30 hrs. And reaching back at 3.00am the next day. We had no choice as other airline flights were not available for 3 people or exorbitantly expensive. We had to continue and checked in. The flight was delayed from scheduled 23.30 hrs on 21st May to 00.45am on 22nd May. We have landed on T2 terminal at 4.20am. We have lost sleep, money and an entire of work day pre travel and post travel. We have barely slept. They have offered a sandwich and Rajma Chawl at the airport. It is a hardship which we will never forget and not recommend SpiceJet to anyone. The leg space between the chair is extremely low. An average height person like us was hitting knee to the seat ahead. Extremely bad experience both ways. There was no courtesy shown to us by SpiceJet ground staff and cabin crew. Just a customary apology was given. We will never recommend Spicejet airlines to anyone. If there was a zero star or negative star to rate, would have picked it to rate the service.",

The web check in for the flight was fine and I had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection. So the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure. The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately. On the whole, for the cheap fare that was paid, the service was what was expected and it's true that even though the airline is going through challenges, there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of.",

No person available to guide passengers to empty counters, people moving from one counter to the other haphazardly in order to check-in faster. It was the worst check in have experienced. Please please please- don't make already exhausted people so angry that they snap at the staff on duty. The airline has value for money but does it mean we need to ignore all the other stupid mistakes that they make?",

Besides the all the promo mail, there wasn't any mail about online check in or that I had to check out from my transfer and check back in. Instead they let me all the way through to the gate and told me on the last moment that I was supposed to check out and back in. And the website was also not clear in that (I checked). I took a sprint to the check out and went back in, but check in was closed and they didn't do anything for me other than telling me that I should have known somehow. No (partly refund), no later flight instead, nothing. Only telling me that I should have known somehow what the procedure is and pointing to the terms and conditions part on my e-ticket, which by the way says nothing about checking out and back in in a transfer flight.

There was a lack of clear communication about the cause of the delay and what steps were being taken to resolve the issue. Furthermore, when the flight finally did depart, it was further delayed due to additional issues with the plane. The staff did not seem particularly concerned about the impact of the delays on passengers and were unapologetic about the situation. Overall, my experience with SpiceJet Airlines was very disappointing and I would not recommend flying with them in the future.",

You will never find a more boorish, crude and unreasonable airline like them, they kept me at Mumbai Airport for almost 10 hrs, no remorse even for our loss, the important meeting I missed, the expenses I had to endure in these 10 hrs in the airport and complete wastage of time.

Allowed weight for infant because it was not mentioned in the ticket. SpiceJet is basically playing with their terms and conditions and incorrectly charging the customer. I was told to go to the link https://corporate.spicejet.com/tnc.aspx point number 14 where it says that passenger travelling with infant are allowed to query 7 kg extra but the lady on the boarding counter clearly that the terms and condition of SpiceJet has been updated and their customer care is not aware about it. The terms and condition now is that mother travelling alone will be allowed 7 kg extra. It seems but they are making their own policy standing on the counter and she told me if I don't pay this amount she will put my luggage back outside the counter. I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg although I was in weight limits what was told to me by customer care of SpiceJet and whatever it was told to me on the board accountable was completely incorrect and not mentioned anywhere in the terms and condition of SpiceJet. It seems that the employees of SpiceJet just play with the customers by making their own terms and conditions on basis of their assumptions. The manager of of boarding counter was very rude she was not even interested to speak to us. They clearly said that if I am paying money extra for just take the luggage away from here. ",

Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn\u2019t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife\u2019s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement.

Now a couple of hours before the flight time which was to start at 5 pm, it has further delayed the flight by 5 hours making me miss the evening program also. This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel. There is absolutely no empathy for the customer. They should have tried to book the passengers in other flights or planned something else.",

Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service.. No wonder SpiceJet is on the verge of collapse and shutting down looking at their quality of staff, meals, aircraft and service. A complete failure of structure, process and outcome indicators. ",

To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number. Wait time was close to 1 hour for an agent to pick and there was no definite response when my luggage will be loaded and when I will receive. Looks like airlines support staff is clueless.",

My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights.

Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up \"timed out\". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight and charged a $69 cancellation fee. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again. I advise you to reconsider Spirit in favour of an Airline that will treat you with respect. What a disgusting experience both with the flight and the very poor customer service.",

We spent $90 per bag to check in.

Then the same attendants were at boarding. They made me zone 1 and my friend\u2019s ticket zone 4, after we spent $180 to bring our bags with us, and checked in together on the same reservation. We didn\u2019t realize this when we started to board. They allowed some people on one reservation board together, but not us! They pulled my friend out of the line then told her she would need to spend $100 more if she didn\u2019t put her wristlet inside her carry on. While that happened, they told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to wait for her. You think you\u2019re getting a deal. Some info they don\u2019t tell you- a checked bag is 40 lbs, not the usual 50. A carry on is $80 and a checked bag is $89. It is $20 minimum to secure a seat. Extra charge to use the Wi-Fi. No TV\u2019s. No leg room (and I\u2019m 5 feet tall). Never again.

So, on 7/12/2023, one of us used the spirit app to check the terms and payment deduction detail of cancellation because we want to decide whether to cancel or change or just keep it in order protect my benefits. In the app, she clicked the button \"modify my trip\", i.e., cancel or change my trip. It then led her to the cancel button. But she didn't expect after clicking this, the app switched to the website and after uploading a while it cancelled my flights directly and automatically without providing us with the terms and results and the payment detail. Then it led her back to my app, our trip information is all gone. And after the system cancelled our reservation without getting our permission, later the spirit sent an email to Jingyao Li who paid the tickets with a form of money deduction detail and a 10-dollar voucher. How dare they to do this without mentioning us about the fee detail and results in the app and when it switched to the cancellation processing on the website. We have spent 394.54 dollars, but in the end, we are forced to be given a 10-dollar voucher for future Spirit trip. If we were informed that we cannot get refund and the payment detail of cancellation when clicking the button in the app, we would have not used to app to click it. The Spirit company has the obligation to notice the customers about the fee detail and terms agreement option when they click cancel button to let them know the detail not just cancelling directly and automatically without customer's permission. Besides, there are three of us. The app didn't provide us with the chance to decide whether to keep it or more changes but directly switched to the website and cancelled all of our reservation. It was crazy and unbelievable. we tried hard immediately to contact with the staff, but they said the website showed flights were cancelled and they can do nothing for us. So, what's the point of asking the staff for help if everything the company relies on is the non-customer friendly website and tricky app. Due to their refusal of any help about our case, we have to rebook and reschedule our trip. Our request is that Spirit gives us full refunds of this payment fee $394.54. We were very disappointed because we got nothing, no flights, no service and no help. They used their system bug to try to pass the buck and got our money. We have nerve seen such an unreliable airline company.",

Pls if you dont want to get scammed, dont fly with this airline. You are better off paying a little more for a ticket because in the end, when all their charges add up for every little thing they can think of, you will end up paying more and the customer service sucks.

You pay an initial low fare, but the additional fees for everything will make the flight much more expensive than taking another airline. If your bag is a couple pounds over 40 lbs, $90 extra. Do you want to make sure your family sits together? $15 additional per seat. We paid around $200 for our checked luggage, then had to pay an additional $90 because my bag was 45 lbs. Their max is 40. Lines took forever and we got stuck in security. We made it to the gate while the door was still opened, but they shut it with us standing there boarding passes in hand. They didn't care. \"Sorry, you'll have to rebook\". No more available flights to Ft. Lauderdale that day which means we were going to miss our cruise ship. Meanwhile, our luggage was on the plane without us on it's way to Ft. Lauderdale. Thanks to Southwest, we found a flight to make our ship, but we couldn't get anyone from Spirit on the phone in Ft. Lauderdale to see about getting our luggage which was only 30 minutes away from the port. No one answered, no one cared. We made our cruise, but without our luggage.

        "Review": "  3 friends and I planned to fly from Boston to Santo Domingo on June 22nd via Orlando and had the most horrible experience. Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging. Most horrible airline ever.",

Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up \"timed out\". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again. I advise you to reconsider Spirit in favour of an Airline that will treat you with respect",

She had already called her daughter to drive to Atlanta and pick her up. Atl airport is 2 1/2-3 hours from Augusta, she said I could tag along. I was so grateful, I would have had to spend the night in the Atlanta airport, it is after midnight at this time. Last shuttle pick up is 12:00 midnight. My daughter drove from Augusta to meet me about an hour away where they dropped me off. So the shuttle service doesn't give a refund, only a credit to be used within the year.

The plane left over 21 minutes earlier than scheduled. She was given replacement tickets, but leaving from Atlantic City instead. She spent the entire night awake at Airport with cats. In a.m. she spent $168.03 on Uber to travel to Atlantic city Airport. When arriving in Phoenix (she had change in Orlando fla.), her 1 piece of luggage that she paid $110 for was lost. She lost the 2 hour ride from my friend because of schedule change. The shuttle doesn't allow cats. She paid another 2 hour Uber ride of $153.56 to get to my home. On her return date, 8 days later, she still hadn't received luggage even though they found it 3 days prior. She requested a refund or re-schedule for return flight (without cats) because she refused to travel without receiving her luggage first. It was refused unless she paid a fee costing MORE than the ticket. The luggage arrived 1 hour 50 minutes prior to departure and I live 2 hours away. They labeled her a \"no-show\", but it was her luggage that was the \"no-show\". She now lost her return ride and incurred a shuttle cost of $50. She had to purchase return ticket with Frontier plus baggage cost. There were many other unnecessary costs due to lost luggage, one example being that she had to pay out of pocket for virtual Dr. visit for emergency script of meds that she was becoming ill to be without. Her Spirit tickets cost $591.36, Uber $321.59, Shuttle $50 etc., etc., etc. Needless to say, she has been ill, overwhelmed, disoriented without clothing changes, meds, and many many other hurdles caused by Spirit. She was traveling to AZ to prep food, hor\u2019dourves, transport necessities and set up at a location for my recently deceased son\u2019s Memorial. I was too ill and was depending on her help. The day was ruined because of complications from this airline. I cannot ever retrieve this day and do-over.",

The one I sent was the link to the obituary since the others would take time. It took all of 30 seconds to tell me that I did not meet the policy. I didn\u2019t understand and I asked what did the mean? They said that I bought the ticket after he had died and I explained that I had not yet received word that my family member had died and I was out of the country when I made the reservation and got the word the following morning.

On the website it strictly dictates backpack, briefcase, purses, etc; as I walk into the area at the FLL security checkpoint. I am stopped and asked to fit my bag in a make shift square which fit but the wheels prevented the bag going clean through meanwhile there were backpacks people were carrying twice the size of my briefcase. I really don\u2019t get this policy if you cannot enforce all sizes of back fitting in that same square. I paid the $89 bag fee to fly onto my next connecting flight to my final destination to make it to the funeral which really is tomorrow but again because Spirit Airlines has no soul and a terrible policy in the event of a family members death.

Yes the flights are less expensive than others listed but that doesn't include baggage fees and if you eat or drink on your flight. The amount paid for baggage on each flight (including our connection) is enough for another flight or 2, it's outrageous. They also damaged one of our bags and the whole handle to hold it and roll it along is broken off, who knows if they will actually provide a refund for that even though they claim to do so. We called to get that taken care of and were ignored. There were also no power outlets on any of our flights to charge any devices. I have never been more miserable flying than I have been with Spirit this time around. We will never fly with this company again and will encourage others to look elsewhere also.",

I\u2019ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that I\u2019m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time I\u2019m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months. Next step is waiting for my full refund. When I initially purchased the tickets it wasn\u2019t about the price of the ticket but the time of the flights that fit well with my schedule. Spirit mostly likely will not be that option for me in the future.",

The team members all need frequent practical and developmental courses on how to deal with passengers whenever there is a situation involving delays and or flight cancelation. It was as if, passengers affected by these circumstances are not seen as important anymore.

Then the only way to make a complaint is to write an email to their terrible non-existent customer service. The only way to talk to a Spirit agent is to book flights (to take your money). If they cancel your flight or cause you an inconvenience, then it's email. One-way customer service is not customer service. Now I know one of the reasons why Spirit has a bad reputation.",

I talked to over 10 agents on the phone about how important my baggage was and no one seemed to think it was a big deal. I paid a total of $392 for my baggage to arrive in Nashville and it took 5 days. They will not refund me my baggage costs or what I spent on a new airline or hotel. They gave me a $50 voucher, because that will surely help fight breast cancer and I will surely fly spirit again\u2026. NOT!

        "Review": "  Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach. I would caution others against booking flights with Spirit Airlines, and I hope that Expedia.com can improve their customer support and advocacy for their users in such situations.",

Then when flying home from Portland because I\u2019m seated zone 3 the attendant charged my rolling bag which which is the same size as a duffel bag and charged me 100$. I said well are you going to take my bag to luggage and he said no now you can place on top in the cabinets. He gave me a look like I was an idiot and said man this has been our policy for 15 years, I told him my bag fit and your the first airline to charge to now be able to place my bag on top in the cabinet.

        "Review": "  I wish I had read reviews before purchasing a flight from Spirit Airlines. I thought I was getting a bargain on bringing my bike for $75 round trip. Turns out that was only one way, so it was actually $150 round trip, but that was just the beginning. After multiple gate and time changes, my return flight was cancelled at 2a. I stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights. By 430a, I was rebooked on the earliest flight available, the red eye that night. I spent money on a Lyft back to the area of the city that I was familiar with, and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so I could book a place to shower and nap. If my time itself is not included, I lost $350 on an AirBnB, Lyft rides and meals. If you value my time spent on this endeavor, and I do, add on another $240. Altogether taking a chance on Spirit Airlines cost me an extra $437 (paid for non-existent wifi access on return flight, bike return, extra meals, place to stay and cab/Lyft rides) out of pocket and another minimum $240 in opportunity costs. So not only did I not save money, I spent way more on this Spirit Airlines trip than booking my trip on American Airlines would have cost me. On a positive note, I interacted with over a dozen polite, cheerful and helpful employees of the airline. Two were obnoxiously rude and antagonistic, one so much so that because of her alone I would hesitate to fly with Spirit Airlines again. However they were so many other friendly and helpful employees that deserve a positive review. I hope good things come their way.",

If you want to charge money for carrion, do it, but educate your staff and provide implicit bias training to those rude and uneducated employees.",

        "Review": "  I am a vibrant 78 year old woman and I have travelled internationally for most of my life so I am not easily intimidated by the challenges that air travel can involve. That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business. Avoid them at all costs.",

Went to Spirit desk to get rebooked along with the rest of the plane and was told they wouldn't cover a hotel or any food (which is illegal) and then lied and said the reason they couldn't take off was weather related so they wouldn't be obligated to pay as that's \"an Act of God\" so we had to get our own food, Ubers and hotel which cost even more before going to our next flight they gave us (a worse flight too, no longer direct) with no reimbursement in any fashion. We even missed work because of this. That flight is also delayed in Orlando which resulted us not getting home until 3 in the morning with work the next day. There was even a fight at the gate which Spirit employees did nothing about! Don't even try to contact they're customer service either, they were all rude and unhelpful of they answered at all. When I told one of them Spirit's policy was breaking the law by not providing accommodations they said \"Yes, that is correct\". Which I promptly took a screenshot of. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help escalate any of these issues to someone who could do something about it. The only recourse they give you is legal action.

        "Review": "The US Airways flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia were fine and so was my domestic flight to Memphis. However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were \"no problem\". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, \"don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute\". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair. This episode was a complete nightmare, most of the staff were just plain rude, with two exceptions of the ground crew at the departure gate. ",

The next flight they didn't even have us sitting next to each other. She was two rows behind me on the opposite side of a full plane, with both of us having middle seats. Nobody trades you seats for a middle seat. We had three planes to board out of San Diego on our way home. Not one time were the seats next to each other.

I called to get a seat assignment and was told that I could not be pre-assigned a seat among the seats remaining, unless I paid a fee. This is outrageous. I have already paid for a ticket. They have to give me a seat. So why can't I call and choose among the remaining seats. I was told it would not be fair to other passengers, but that doesn't make sense. Other passengers could call ahead, too, if they wished. US Airways just wants an excuse to charge people extra for seats they have already paid for. That is what is unfair. From now on I will look carefully and only book flights on airlines that pre-assign seats or allow one to choose seats when they book, a choice US Airways does not give passengers who book on Expedia. This is an unpleasant surprise to passengers who would like to sit with their spouse or other traveling companion. On top of this, the phone representative was rude.",

No IFE in first class. For the money you pay you would expect music at the very least. You have to log into GoGo and pay the extra. No access to the Admirals Club in the airport. This is just disgraceful. I was told (after having to wait 10 minutes for 2 customer service agents to finish a personal conversation) it would be $50 dollars a person extra. Outrageous. The food was marginal, not bad but not great either. On the flight to Phoenix it was slightly better. On the way back to Boston both meal selections were olive based dishes. Come on guys give someone a non-olive choice. The made to order ice Sundays were good. When we got in they had a problem hooking up the jetway so everyone was standing for about 10 minutes. In the middle of this, one of the ground crew mistakenly pulled the APU cord which cut all the lights - so we were in the dark. The pilot started yelling at the ground crew (not very professional). Clearly no team at work here. Check in staff in Phoenix were very nice and helpful. Less so in Boston but not bad.  Will fly Delta next time.",

The touch-screen to manage the inflight-entertainment was a 'little-shop-of-horrors' in terms of handling.

Although I provided documentation that this was part of the Phoenix, Lima trip, she didn't care and became rude when I pressed the issue. The flight crew were fine, and airplane was normal. Just that the ticketing people are completely unreasonable and rude.",

Boarding starting at midnight and was fully boarded before the pilots showed up - first pilot at 12.20am and second pilot at 12.24am. Second-only a blanket was available for each passenger, no pillows available on an all-night flight. Third-no beverages were made available even in first class. Fourth-at no time did any of the crew apologize for the delay or for the lack of amenities. Fifth-the plane itself had no electronics available at all - no video screens and no outlets for electronics - truly very Spartan. Sixth-at 7am EDT the first beverages were offered along with the \"first class\" continental breakfast which consisted of a small croissant roll, a packet of almond butter, a small tube of strawberry preserves, a wedge of cheese and a mint - not \"first class\" at all. Seventh-the flight landed and we left the aircraft at 8.58am EDT. In summary, I would not recommend US Airways as a source to use for night-time intercontinental flights. It was a ridiculous example of airline management and treatment of customers.",

After we returned to the airport, we were told that there was another plane ready for us, and were left there for 3 hours waiting for a crew to arrive. In the end there was no crew and the flight was cancelled. It took another 3 hours to rebook everyone on different flights. It was disorganised chaos with no guidance whatsoever as to how to get vouchers and how to get to our hotels. It was 4am by the time we got to our hotel. I was rebooked on a flight to Brussels via Munich due to depart at 6:30pm on 18 August. After boarding was completed we were told that there was a technical problem - were left on the plane for 1.5 hours without any update. Eventually we were told to disembark and to board another plane. This was the 3rd plane with technical issues in a period of 24 hours. We eventually departed at 10pm. The staff on the flight were extremely rude and patronising. The inflight entertainment was a nightmare to use as the touch screen was pretty much not working.

It was the exact same experience, (minus the bathroom as we were sitting a few rows up) plus incredibly rude flight attendants. We landed pretty early, so waited on the tarmac for quite a while. After some time, I started to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. After 15 minutes I got up to use the bathroom. At that time, a flight attendant turned around and shouted at me \"sit down, you can't get up yet\". We still didn't move for another 5 minutes.

The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying.

Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response, but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways, would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections. Many upset AA/US Airways passengers were in evidence at Charlotte \"International\" Airport. Additionally, rampant, repeated misinformation and; unhelpfulness from US Airways/American Airlines customer service and airport staff. Were told by airport staff at gate we could reclaim luggage at baggage claim - could not be more wrong, they would not \"pull bags\" so I, wife and 2 kids stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. Moreover, had purchased $200 liquor in Duty Free in SJU, but, due to TSA regulations and because we left the secure area, have had to improvise and box bottles for check-through on rescheduled flight - another $25 fee too boot. Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour \"layover\"). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly). You'd think they'd have contingency plan for these sort of events as a rested flight crew is allegedly critical to FAA safety requirements, but they were in the same pickle as we - completely and utterly out of luck!

We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip, but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems, so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room.

The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much.

If you're tall or overweight you are in for a world of pain. I upgraded my seats, and then they ended up putting me on another airline because my original connecting flight in Dallas was having maintenance issues and I wouldn't have made it home. They put me on an Alaska flight from Chicago to PDX in the middle seat for 4.5 hours. To add insult to injury, they still charged me for the upgrade even though I had to switch airlines.

They never advised us to check back every 15 minutes like they are supposed to do as I found out later. We went to get something to eat and when we came back in much less than an hour we found the plane had left without us. It also left with our valuable instruments we had gate checked! We finally convinced the customer service lady to please have somebody meet the plane and store the instruments until we could finally get there. The return trip was no better as they cancelled us from the return flight because we had missed our original flight from Phoenix. We had to fight to get back on the plane. The return flight was no better! If you fly US Air be ready to hear \"We are so sorry but your flight has been delayed because of 'insert reason' and we will get you in the air as soon as possible\". I heard this so many times when I was stranded in the airport in Phoenix. The flight attendants don't really care either and the whole company seems to display this kind of attitude. ",

At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in. On the short flight, there was no beverage service but that is a small matter. On the whole, I will do everything possible to avoid US Air in the future. Ground services were appalling.",

        "Review": "This was the most horrible experience. We were trying to leave BWI, when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay, it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we \"should\" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling \"should\" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to \"maintenance\" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fianc\u00e9 and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover.  The worst $700 spent for a mediocre travel that could have been avoided if they had their act together.",

I usually fly Air Canada and Star Alliance Partners, so I chose US Airways based on them being a former partner. I was surprised, comparing the flight to Canadian airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet. The Seats were not at all what I would have expected, there was no IFE system on A319 or CRJ, but that was expected on the CRJ. Cabin Crew was very nice and pleasent. There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly. Safety Briefing was done by the flight crew but it seemed that they were tired of doing it. Not many were paying attention and I believe a safety video would be more effective. For the value of what I paid for, I'd say it was very much worth it.",

Despite the fact that there were open seats on the earlier flight I was not permitted to change flights.

When I got to the airport it was buzzing with stranded travelers waiting to check in. The US Airways kiosks were useless because they only accept boarding passes. It was chaos.

Boarded the 5 year old aircraft, an A330-200, on time and in an organised manner. Within 30 minutes crew came through with a drinks run. Wine and soft drinks free, with a fee for spirits. Lunch followed and was very tasty. Small salad, main chicken dish with a nice desert. Nothing spectacular but very edible for airplane food. The crew, all but one, seemed happy and cheerful and interacted with the passengers as they came through the cabin. They came through the cabin with another juice and water run about an hour later and after that we got an expected treat of chocolate ice cream. About an hour before landing in Charlotte we were given a tasty paninni snack and cupcake with an offer of another drink or tea or coffee. The entertainment system worked well and had a good choice of movies. I honestly could not fault these guys with the way they delivered the service and how they made an 8 hour flight fly by!",

We ask the flight attendant if she could please contact our next flight and ask them to wait. She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call. Thankfully the flight to London was only 25% occupied at most and we were able to stretch out. The flight to DUS was with British Airways and went smoothly except for a slight 10 minutes delay. On the return flight our flight was cancelled with no reason given. We were lucky we checked early and immediately called customer service. They said they couldn't put us on another flight for about 3 hours until they finally caved in and put us on a flight departing in a few hours with Air Berlin meaning we got no sleep.

Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.",

I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive.

E-190 seats in economy are wide and pretty comfortable for a 3 hour flight. No inflight Entertainment but WIFI is available. New commuter terminal at PHL is pretty good also with a new Admirals Club and large food court. Express Dash 8 flight pretty standard almost on time but noisy and bumpy for the 1 hour flight to CHO. Returned on AA was cancelled with about 3 hours notice rebooked on US at 5am the next day. Went to Airport anyway and received a hotel voucher and spent another night. Early flight from CHO meant no airport shuttle so took acb. CRJ-200 to CLT PSA CRJ seats are pretty decent much better than Mesa not service what so ever even though almost 50 minutes in the air. Connected to a CRJ-900 for the 3 hour flight to AUS. Have taken this in the past with trepidation. CRJ's just aren't that comfortable with no inflight entertainment and no Wifi. 2 Beverage runs and we were almost on time. Us Airways Express really needs to pad their times some more. All express flight seem to take longer in the air than are scheduled gate to gate. Overall they did the job but still prefer AA.",

Flight from Phoenix to Charlotte taxied on the runway for 30 minutes and left 25 minutes late. Two of these flights had another crew on them flying home and they didn't have very nice things to say about their employer. Arrived in Charlotte as my next flight was just arriving \"late\". The passengers disembarked the flight cleaned and we boarded 30 minutes later and left the ground 20 minutes after that. Very little information about what was going on from the crew. Departing Philadelphia the flight boarded on-time but my original seat from what I reserved online was changed at check in and I was moved to the last seats and by a window and next to the engine. It was so loud I couldn't hear my music and had to fly with earplugs in my ears. After the captain figured out that he was on the wrong runway he told us and said there was going to be a delay of 15-20 minutes. When we finally landed at Dallas my flight was supposed to be boarding but after running to the gate the flight had been delayed due to weather and other flights. I had just come from the east coast and checked the weather and I didn't see anything that could have delayed a flight. I don't fly very much but this trip was ridiculous. No matter what the price is I wont ever fly American or US Airways.",

        "Review": "Flew from Washington to Boston on Economy. Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre. I understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time - not dismissive.",

When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be. I get to that airport and am told the flight is full I will have to wait for another flight. I said no I am travelling with three other people my husband child and elderly mother - I then wait for hours in another airport. In the end I did get on the plane.

We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag \"because there wasn't any bin space left\" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were \"confiscating\" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said \"no it's already gone.\" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a \"well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left.\" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a \"convenience\" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late \"push back\" if people are seated faster. Of course \"their convenience\" translates into \"our inconvenience.\" Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said \"I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.\"",

Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left. We had not eaten all day.",

Waited with 2 kids in the flight till 11.40. got one small badam packet, water and a burger as dinner. Again around 11.40 received an update the crew just reached and still searching for bag. After an hour , received update need to change flight crew and they are going to another gate 126 and board again at 1.15 am est. Waited till 1.15 am in flight, again received an announcement that flight is cancelled. We were asked to get down and many didnt even realize the flight is cancelled. Got announcement that collect luggage in drop 5 and the bags were being sent slowly almost taking 1.5 hrs even to get the luggage. Also they asked one counter will be open till 3 am and we have to rebook if required before 3 am. The one counter which was open till 3 am, there was a huge line and almost till 7.30 we were just standing on line. Finally fed up and booked a hotel by ourself and many hotels didnt allow check in during that time. finally we got one for paying 300$ for 4 hours, booked cab by ourself. at 1.30 qe received a message that we got meal vouchers value 15$, 2 per passenger. the worst airline and the pain we had on that night with 2 kids are unbearable. after long struggle we booked air India from JFK, initial trip was from newark. Unexpected delays or cancelations are understandable, but airlines should be able to handle the passengers during the situation.",

First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in. I found myself longing for the business-class check-in desks at the other, non-U.S. carriers in the International Terminal, carriers that actually seem to offer a premium service to people who have paid for it. I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag. Unfortunately, United is the only airline apart from budget carrier French Bee that flies from SFO to Tahiti nonstop. For any other international route where there's competition, however, I wouldn't conceive of ever flying United Polaris again.",

At the boarding and luggage check booth, where there were nearly 100 people waiting, there was one attendant on duty - it took a solid hour just to print my boarding pass and check my luggage. All other airlines had several attendants working. After sprinting to my gate, I found out that the flight had been delayed for 3 full hours. When we finally boarded, I got a message saying that my connecting flight to Rochester had been cancelled. After standing not one, but two customer service lines, I was able to book a flight to Syracuse. Originally leaving at 9:30, the flight was again delayed by an hour. We landed at 12:00 am, but taxied for another 40 minutes because the airline had sent an unscheduled flight to our departure gate for cleaning. Never in my life have I experienced this level of negligence at an airline. On transferring to Syracuse I asked the customer service representative if I had to re-check my baggage. She told me \"no\", and that I was \"in the system\". I asked the concierge at the gate for Syracuse the same thing - he said \"no\". After deplaning, I discovered that my luggage had been left in Newark. It is now 11:00 pm the next day, and the luggage has just now been delivered to my hotel.

        "Review": " I wouldn\u2019t waste my time going on a United flight. They are horrible at doing their jobs. I had a toddler with me who was supposed to sit on my lap. We were traveling with my spouse and the kiosk wouldn\u2019t allow check in. We came in two hours before our flight and got tossed around. We were advised to see a kiosk with an attendant on it waited 30 minutes and we still couldn\u2019t get checked in. At this point we had a little under an hour to get everything done yet no one knows how to get my boarding pass printed with my lap baby. My husband was able to board but I missed my flight. They told me to wait on a line that took over 2.5 hours to get to a rep and that as far as they are concerned I missed my flight even though there was still time. I had two employees bicker in front of my family because the employee asked another employee to assist and she didn\u2019t like that we were thrown on her. After I waited for 2.5 hours to get this situation rectified the rep told me there was nothing he can do because the confirmation was split once my husband got his pass and I essentially lost my reservation and had to wait 1.5 hours to get ahold of a reservation specialist on the phone. FYI they don\u2019t have reservation specialists in the airport. United employees doesn\u2019t take responsibility or try to correct the situation. I was left to make other plans with another airline company as being stranded in an airport with a toddler wasn\u2019t going to work. I went to JetBlue and they had zero issues with processing my lap baby\u2019s pass. United doesn\u2019t care about their customers, if they had it there way I would have been stranded for two days. Also they are unbelievably understaffed and we\u2019re cancelling a lot of flights. There was a mob of angry people. Save your money, they may be worse than southwest and spirit at this point. I will never purchase from them again & they should honestly be ashamed of the \u201cservice\u201d they provide.",

After several delays that flight was canceled and I was rebooked for a 9pm flight the next day or 26 hours later. After talking to an agent he got me a standby ticket for a 7am flight the next morning. After spending the night at airport, it looked like I would get a seat on the 7am flight. Even received a text from United saying \"Good news\" I had seat on that flight. Then after all the groups had boarded I approached agent desk and handed them my ticket and the agent announced they would be calling the standbys by name. So I sat back down, fully expecting my name to be called. She then pointed to a gentleman and he was allowed to board. She the pointed to another gentleman and asked him for his name. He answered an she said he could board. But he was with his wife. Agent said there was only one seat available and the agent let wife board and they were done boarding. I approached agent and showed her messaged from United that I had a seat on that flight. She said she had no idea what that message meant. I knew what it meant. It meant she had given my seat to someone else. instead of reading from the list of standbys like she said she would she handpicked her standbys. The only reason. I didn't raise a fuss then is I wanted to get home not on the \"No fly list\".",

We had to take a Taxi from Regan to IAD while carrying our luggage: $75. After we boarded our 10 PM flight from IAD to Amman, it circled around for 2 hours then it was cancelled. We stood in line waiting for a representative to serve us from 12 (Midnight) tell 10 AM (10 hours waiting, not kidding, while standing, in the airport).

Spend time in a long line for the travel assistance for rebooking the flight, and then trying to figure out where to spend a night or few nights before the next flight. I was coming from a wonderful European vacation on July 9th. As soon as I arrived to the Newark airport, I received a very unwelcome message that my connecting flight was canceled. The next 4 hours were extremely frustrating. The United App was not working. Long line to the travel assistance full of frustrated customers, elderly people, and parents with young crying children kept growing. A travel agent informed me that a seat for me is available no earlier than July 12th. I registered for the standby for the earliest flight the next day as well. I, as every other person in that line, needed to find a place to spend a night, possibly 3 nights. The agent was kind enough to give me 3 vouchers $15 each. I am a full time employee and have responsibilities. So, I had to inform my manager about my encounter. The next day I spent \u201ccamping out\u201d at the Newark airport on a standby list. The overbooking practices help maximize the profits and brings hefty bonuses to the top management of the airline at the expense of their customers. In Europe airlines are penalized with high fines for overbooking. The airline should be able to develop a backup plans for bad weather, and not use it (bad weather) as an excuse for inconvenience, keeping travelers stranded for days, passing down the operating cost to customers. Seems like customer experience is not important for United airlines. ",

Toronto was my final destination. Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I spoke to United Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, \"look out for it at carousel 9\" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. Saying that, luckily I saw my bag on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in myself. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport! I know this because United Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem. Again, I was guaranteed that it will be with me. I've already made arrangements to get it delivered to an address, it'll take 2-3 days for me to receive it. ",

Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable. This is the first time in all my years of travel I have encountered such poor baggage service. I'm inclined to not use United again, but then I would lose my Premier access status with its Star Alliance partners. I would reluctantly recommend United as I have never had this issue before.",

Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, \"Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer\". If anyone came up to ask a question, \"Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal\". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go \"illegal\". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport. Trust me, I could tell the difference of this hotel as I arrived in the parking lot. The next morning, I started my travels.",

We arrive 2 hours early here in Birmingham to be told your flight here has been delayed and you will miss your connecting flight in Houston to Los Angeles. You have the choice to stay here in Birmingham or fly to Houston and we will provide a hotel room. Okay we chose to fly to Houston because who knows what could happen. We end up in a storm in Houston no fault to United Airlines but the issue is we lost a day in Honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued. So we fly 7 1/2 hours straight to Honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window. So I didn\u2019t get the beautiful view of what I wanted to see. The food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and I was thankful we ate dinner. The flight back wasn\u2019t even better. We got delayed in Los Angeles because the flight attendant was late in Honolulu. Then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers. However the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers. Things could have been worse but paying for baggage, being re-seated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels. We still lost money and a day in Honolulu. I say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses. Also on the flight home from Houston there was no wi-fi service so that sucked. Y\u2019all ask if I would refer you all to others as a last resort but no.",

First, my flight at 5:40 was canceled just hours before it was supposed to take off. I decided to go at 3 to wait on standby for the next flight to Chicago at 4:45, which is what was recommended on the phone by United Customer Service. I was 6th in line. The 4:45 one left and I was unable to get in. I waited for one at 7:30 but was also unable to get in. However, by that time, they told me that I am 2nd in line and had to wait 4 more hours for the next flight. I found out about an hour before the next flight at 11 that I was kicked off the waiting list for no reason. I tried to find anyone from United to speak to about this but there was absolutely no one there to help. One of the later flights at 11:30 kept getting delayed till about 1 in the morning, and as for the other flight, I was informed that I was, once again, the 6th in line. I spent 9 hours in the airport yesterday and I am sure United does not care about me or a lot of their other customers in my same situation.

No one wants to wait there and take time out of their day just for them to reschedule the flight and then cancel it the day before or the day of the flight. Worst part is that they sent out our luggage to Orlando while we are still in Houston. So now we were left without luggage even though United Airlines told us that they will not send our luggage until we are sent out to Florida but come to find out they sent it out either way. So we are left without a plane ride to Florida and we have no luggage. I do not recommend this airline to any one.

Not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight, surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt. I don't care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash. The way they treat their loyal customers is trash. Their fleet is old and trash. Their food is poor. Their loyalty program is terrible because they have too many 1k'ers. You pretty much have to pay for an upgrade if you want one. I finally got a flight on one of their FEW newer planes and they cancel it. I'm going to get on every review site I can think and tell people to fly Delta. They are at least more reliable and probably have a newer fleet and may very well treat their loyalty customers better. United is a greedy airline.",

We were first delayed in the Salt Lake Airport for 8 1/2 hours, missing our connection by several hours and being forced to stay in San Francisco for about 16 hours until the next flight from there left to Tel Aviv. Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process. Though we continually call, fill out forms, send emails, and the like, we have yet to see a dime of compensation for this truly terrible experiences. We stayed in touch with some other people on our flight and they continued to have problems with United (missed connections and the like) and were never compensated. The best that they were able to do was offer $300 vouchers for another flight. Are you kidding me? You think a silly $300 voucher could make up for the money we lost and the horrible experience we had? Not likely. As we are never planning to fly United again, a voucher is honestly just an insult at this point. We also heard that the employees of United are so disgruntled with the company that they are planning a strike. Do yourselves a favor and do not fly United.",

What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of $2800 USD in out of pocket expenses, in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal, a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking, claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was \u201cno longer a United passenger.\u201d I told her, the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained (after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues) that United had not actually booked me, it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me, even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didn\u2019t step aside because I \u201chad already used up 30 minutes of their time,\u201d which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone, all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket, via the United app, travelled to another terminal (C) and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated, I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me $2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City, but that flight DID make it and I\u2019m now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers. Shame on them and on lawmakers who allow this level of negligence and disregard for passengers\u2019 wellbeing (see reports of the atrocious conditions in some terminals especially Newark terminal C). I will never travel with United or through the US again for that matter.",

After 30 minutes delays that was not an issue for me it flew. My First class seat was nothing like first. The seat was small and my legs had no support, seats were not even half way reclined which was the most important point for me to book a first class ticket. Food was good and no claim regarding that. The worst part of my journey was the second ticket from Newark to SNA that was cancelled due to the Weather while other flights had no issue regarding that. I tried to call them, they put me on hold and no answer. I tried to book another ticket they all got booked in a minute. I had flight insurance that did not help me in this situation! The first available ticket was for two days later. Me and my sister had no place to stay since she was moving out of NYC and she returned her home keys. We had to book a hotel, move all of our stuff there. I had job interview that I lost that opportunity due to this cancellation. I was so lucky to get a new first class ticket from American Airlines and reach Orange County safely. ",

Our flight UA441 was scheduled to depart from EWR at 11:07 am and arrive at FLL at 2:16 pm. Then it said on the screen that the flight was delayed 3 hours due to staff issues where it said there was no cabin crew or captain/pilot available for the flight. I understood about the issue carefully and listened to all communications from UA provided to customers. Our vacation to Florida, absolutely ruined due to the bad customer services we have received from United Airlines. We are currently searching for alternatives to make up for the cancelled flight.

When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything...it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s).

This two hour delay would have resulted in missing our connection and the international flight from LAX to MEL, but we found a flight out of CLT to LAX with absolutely no help from the AVL United employee (he gave us a phone number to call and sent us on our way, saying there was nothing he could do for us, even though he had just finished helping the couple in front of us with the same itinerary delays). Made it to LAX in time to catch the initial flight to MEL after booking the flight ourselves. Made it to our seats only to wind up sitting on the tarmac for two hours due to a flat tire caused by \u201crunning over a washer\u201d (read: negligence) on the runway. By the time the tire was fixed, the crew was over their authorized hours, and the flight was canceled. We were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination (Melbourne), but we were rebooked to Sydney, which is about 539 miles off our initial destination. In order to solve this, we were directed to another United customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50+ United customers dealing with similar \u201crebooking\u201d issues. It was 2:00 am by the time we were able to talk to a United customer service employee, and good god I wish we hadn\u2019t. For two hours we stood at that counter and did not get a straight answer to our questions, ie.) He told us he booked tickets for our party of 4 on the same alternative route to Melbourne, but when we checked our itineraries, the flights were still destined for Sydney or, to our surprise, Brisbane. When we asked for the tickets to be printed, we were told there were only 2, even though all 4 of us at the counter repeatedly had to remind him there were 4 of us. On top of this, a customer that had been previously helped cut his way in line twice to commandeer Pax\u2019s attention even though we requested he wait so we could have a chance to get our stuff sorted out as well. It was 4:30 am at this time, we were given a motel voucher by Pax, and told we had rooms booked for the night, but when we called the motel to verify, we were informed we had no bookings and there were no rooms available\u2026 Cots were eventually provided for customers that didn\u2019t have any options other than spending the night in the airport, only to be collected about an hour and a half later\u2026 The United customer service line has been long and slow moving all day already, which indicates that these issues are still persisting, and United is not prioritizing the one thing it needs to: its customers.",

I stood in line for over nine hours and when I got to the front all they gave me was stand by tickets. Therefore, on Sunday I want all over the airport and the flights I got was it's cancelled or fully booked. I got a ticket for West Palm beach on Monday late at night and I was promised a seat. On Monday when I got to the airport and was supposed to check my luggage in, I saw that the flight had been changed. Instead of having a promised seat they had changed me to a stand by to Miami. there was nothing I could do than to go to that gate and hope for the best. The flight was supposed to go by half eight pm but got delayed to nine pm then eleven pm then one am then three am and in the end the cancelled it and put me on stand by on a flight that was leaving seven am. That flight was fully booked and a long stand by waiting list so I decided to rent a car instead. I have spent three days here at the airport with no good help or any chance of getting out of here. My experience with United was very bad and I hope this makes you not want to take this company. This has been a very exhausting three days and also three days where I was supposed to be on vacation and having a good time, and not sitting waiting for flights just for them to be cancelled or not have a seat for me.",

        "Review": " My cousin is walker/wheelchair bound. We waited nearly an hour for a wheelchair to be brought to us to move throughout the Newark Airport one we landed. 20 of those minutes we were stuck on the ramp because there was no way to get him off the plane as even the isle chairs were unavailable. We finally got to the gate after an attendant retrieve an isle chair from who knows where. Due to the long wait my cousin needed to use the restroom, but the gate attendant refused as the isle chair is not for travel throughout the airport. I left after 10 minutes of arguing between the gate and flight attendants (who were helping us) to avoid a serious embarrassment. When we returned, no one was there anymore. Another gate attendant at a different gate made 4 separate calls for chairs not only for my disabled cousin, but another elderly lady also waiting an hour for assistance. We spoke to a manager about this absurd wait. She was apologetic and took our information. I am thankful we decided to fly in a day early for my cousin's medical trials, as this would have caused him to be late for his treatments otherwise.",

        "Review": "  Shocking treatment by United Airlines of 2 elderly people and an infant, leaving us stranded and paying over $1,000 for hotel + food over the Boston Marathon weekend - and when we filed a complaint, United refused to compensate us even one cent! We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane\u2019s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all. ",

It is very inefficient and it wastes time you do not have. In 4/2020 I was supposed to go to Manchester but COVID happened. Virgin did give me a credit which was great. Fast forward to 2022, I wanted to book a flight to Cancun and use my credit. They had no flights and I don't mean like full, I mean none going the week of 6/27 which I found insane and when you try and book online it only allowed you to book with points and not money. In any case, I wanted to get a refund for my ticket and you can't call and speak to anyone you have to fill out a form and wait 48 hours for someone to reach out to you. A  staff member finally text me. He was very nice and he processed my return. One day later, I realized that the card I originally used is cancelled. So I text back at that number and I got an automated message to fill out another form. So I go back and do that and now three days later I get an e-mail from customer service to tell me what happens to the money. So I had one more question for him. I e-mail back and you get another automated message to fill out the form and someone will get to you in 48 hours. I will never fly Virgin because this is disgusting and a lot of time and energy wasted. Once I get my money back, they will never waste my time again. ",

The flight status was not even available until about 24 hours in advance. My husband and I both called the recommended phone number and were put on hold for over 2 hours and then hung up on. The next day, we called back and were put in a queue. It took over three hours to get a call back. When we finally talked to a human being, we were re-routed to customer service and then hung up on. Flights have gone up in price since we booked, and they would not give us a refund that would cover the price of a new flight or book us on another flight the same day, which means we will lose money pre-paid on hotels and rental cars at our destination and have to pay out of pocket for the difference in a last-minute flight to get there. They just do not work with you at all or even try to understand your needs or respond to you in a timely manner. I will never be booking with Virgin again, and advise customers to beware \u2014 if your flight is cancelled due to the airline itself (where they should really step up to assist you), you may not even receive a full refund and may not reach your destination.",

The airline is nonetheless Leaps and Bounds better than United or American or even Southwest. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. The snacks and beverages were top-notch. The staff however seemed to be distant and indifferent. This is the opposite of Alaska where the staff is so passionate and helpful. The departure and arrival were prompt and punctual. All in all, the flight was very good. I just wish the staff seemed to be more connected and not so apathetic.",

        "Review": "  San Francisco to Dallas. Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home. At the gate, the agent took my boarding pass from me and handed me a different one. I didn't notice till I got on the plane that my seat had been switched to a non-exit row 7A. When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane. The flight attendant was by this point thoroughly embarrassed and came back to apologize and brought me a glass of wine. She was great but I will never fly Virgin America again.",

They stated the reason that there was a lot traffic in LAX. I wish they could have let us know earlier, not when we were at the gate. The second time I flew back from LAX. My car seat was missing and then they delivered it to my home later in the week. However, the car seat was broken when we received it. I called them to locate the missing part so that we could fix it ourselves. People that spoke to were nice but they did not do anything to help me solve the issue but told me to call different departments. Finally I was told to call central baggage which is voicemail only department. Called and left voicemail twice but never got a call back. Our car seat is for our new first baby which is designed for use up to 2 years and we could only use it for 2 months. Another thing is that I wasn\u2019t asking them to pay or compensate, I was just asking to help find and deliver the remaining part to us so we could put the car seat together and fix it ourselves but they never contacted us to give us an answer. The ticket was $350 round trip but our car seat-strolller system cost about the same. It\u2019s even more costly to fly with virgin America. I don\u2019t recommend this airline.",

The water in the plane was frozen so our flight was delayed taking off. I was seated in the very last row of the airplane and when the repair crew was trying to defrost the water they kept the exterior door open. It was windy that morning and the outside temperature was around -6 below zero. I put on all the layers of clothing I had with me but was still completely frozen. I asked for a blanket or some sort of assistance and the flight attendant just kept saying no ma'am but the repair will be done soon. This went on for about 40-45 minutes with no resolution or even basic assistance. Every time the flight attendant walked by me visibly frozen, upset and uncomfortable he just kept repeating it will be warm soon. This is outrageously bad customer service and I recommend that no one ever make the mistake of flying Virgin America.",

Making the reservation ended up in my having to cancel what I had already booked because they wouldn\u2019t let my small dog on that flight. So an agent in Denver assisted me in canceling that one and booking a new one. However he forgot to assign seats. When I discovered this error 2 days before the flight, I was told there were no free seats left and would have to pay $60 for premium seats. I should have fought it because it seemed like an agent error but I paid it. Then we got to the airport and paid another $100 for the bags. So for a short flight, we paid $160 just for seats and bags not including the actual flight which was around $475 including $100 for my dog. I kept getting flight status emails for the canceled flight, nothing on the new flight. Once we arrived at Palm Springs airport, the flight was to board at 4, take off at 4:42. At 4:15 and no plane at the gate, we asked the agent for an update. Then we were told there\u2019s a mechanical problem, no plane will arrive until 5:30, take off around 6:10, an hour and a half past the scheduled time. When I expressed how horrible Virgin is, the agent agreed and said it will all be Alaska Airlines after April 2018. We finally left Palm Springs 3 hours after the scheduled flight at 7:20. Once in SF), we waited 30 mins for our bags. Worst experience in the US ever!! Oh and no free drinks, no apologies, the customer service was very sad.",

Unfortunately, my trip back home was more unsatisfactory. Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said \"you have to wait\". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said \"I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund.\" The steward retort with a \"you do that\". All I could think, and pardon the language, was \"what the heck?\". I have worked in customer service for over a decade, and this is by far the most unprofessional group of employees I have ever encountered. They were rude, unpleasant and just seemed so unhappy. Perhaps they are not suited for this kind of work but the airline needs to acknowledge that.",

Arrived at Las Vegas 2 hrs prior to departure and was advised SFO was experiencing ATC delays due to runway construction and would we mind leaving 1 hr earlier than planned, to ensure we made our connection to AUS. Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly. Would have liked to see a sandwich or salad offering on this sector, as the menu was the same as the short flight to SFO. Arrived on time, our bags were the 2nd ones off due to Priority Tags due to our status. Over all still a great airline that will be missed. If I have a complaint with Virgin America, its the size of the First Class cabin, making it hard to buy FC on short notice trips. If you have to go economy, Virgin America is a good choice though.",

The other 3 flights previous to this one ( different carriers all booked at the same time) were wonderful. As I selected to sit with my wife on each flight, once aboard this flight we were seated on completely opposite sides of the plane. I could care less about food/drink service, flight amenities, or any other part of the flight, but I care about is that I'm sitting next to my wife. Now I'm on a coast to coast flight sitting on opposite sides of the plane.",

        "Review": "  Austin to San Francisco. The flight from to SFO was uneventful and I had a pretty good experience. The return flight not so much. In the end, the flight was 2.5 hours late into Austin. There was no issue with weather; it is still unclear why we had such a delay. Virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed.  Once we pushed back from the gate, it took about 1 hour before we took off. Then, about 20 minutes after take-off, some people started to get up to use the rest room. They were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on. Once the pilot finally turned off the sign, about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane. I waited a while, and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes, I went up and used it. I was in row 5, so very near the front. As I returned to my seat, the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class. I said I understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours, so I had to do what I had to do. She scolded me some more and made me promise that I would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight. Then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room. She refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back. On other flights, we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms. When the crew came through for drinks, they gave mostly ice and only about 2/3 of a cup of soda.  I felt that the flight crew was rude and not very understanding given the situation that they created for their customers, and not very service oriented. The entertainment system was good and the seats were not bad relative to other airlines.",

        "Review": "  Los Angeles to New York JFK. Having flown Virgin about 6 times in the last 2 months I've been very pleased. The purple light in the plane is relaxing and the hostesses are always great. I love the Loft lounge before flights- it makes traveling much more enjoyable. It is $30 extra, but definitely worth it. Either purchase it online or get there early to be able to join it. Tonight I was flying from LAX to JFK at 11:05. Virgin has a policy that you must get to check in 40 mins before if you are checking a bag. I knew this policy which is why when I was in the LAX car pool I tried calling them multiple times because I was at gate 1 and the traffic was moving slowly. I decided to go check in myself and pay my uber driver to meet me there with my bags. I make it to the counter 2-3 mins after the cut off. The agent said curtly that she could not help me because I was late. I said how I tried to call multiple times, but no one answered. I asked what my options were (take off is still 35 mins away) and she said she coult try to put me on Standby for 7am. I asked what I was supposed to do for the next 8 hours and she said to sit on the bench or to get a hotel. I said I would be fine hanging in the Loft till then and I would gladly pay the upcharge because I did not book it for my late flight. She said the lounge was not open when I wanted since Alaska Airlines bought Virgin. I did not know anything about this.  Virgin is more expensive to fly to the East coast, and I never had a problem paying extra because it was better. But since Alaska took over, it just isn't worth it anymore because it really is not better than any airline.",

Three hours before my Sunday evening return flight from Portland was to depart for San Francisco (3:15 p.m. and my flight was scheduled for 6:20 p.m.), I received three text messages from Alaska Airlines letting me know the flight is canceled and I have been rebooked on a 5 a.m. flight from Portland to San Francisco via Los Angeles arriving in San Francisco at 11:40 a.m. the next day, a Monday. There was no explanation given for the flight cancellation. The text message included a toll-free number that did not work when I called it. It said I had a message waiting for me, but when I pressed \"1\" for my message, it said I had no messages. It was a fully automated line and pressing \"0\" did not connect me to an operator, it only repeated the cycle that said I had a message and then said I did not have a message waiting for me. I had to buy a $199 one-way ticket on Southwest that got me back to San Francisco at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. I had a meeting Monday morning at work that I could not miss and Alaska provided no options for rebooking on other flights that would get me back on Sunday night.

The smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card, so if you're on a six hour flight with cash, make sure you eat before. They did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but that's all. Another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything, entertainment-wise and food-wise. Again, these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse, but the most important thing I mentioned was the care given to my luggage.

Instead of politely telling me she had to wait till we took off she aggressively, and extremely rudely commanded two times in a row that I sat down at my assigned seat.

The flight from SFO to EWR was just as good. There was a wide selection of drinks and snacks as well as movies. However, the movies did have to be paid for but I didn't much mind as I had my kindle and 3DS. Cabin crew was also friendly. We did have to enter a hold when approaching Newark as their was bad weather and congestion in the air. But, this was to be expected (after all this is Newark and it happens all the time).

So I call Virgin customer service and they are no help. They tell me to go to the Alaska terminal because that is where my flight was originally booked. So I start the process to head to the international terminal. I'm freaking out at this point that I may miss the flight. I decide to call Alaska customer service before making the trek to the other terminal. The customer service for Alaska was very helpful and the one saving grace of this experience. They told me to go back to the Virgin terminal and try the self check in again. Still no luck. Then they tell me to find a Rep. The Rep who was manning the lines was terrible and unfriendly. She told me I needed to wait in the full check-in line. The line took 40 minutes and it was only 15 people long. Finally I get to the counter and the rep prints my boarding pass no problem. 2 hours later and I'm just making it into the flight. What a terrible experience!

The employees ran for whatever hidden cover they could to avoid questions.

The lack of communication is dumbfounding for an airline who use to pride themselves on customer service and quality. The least they could do is give us a free movie for the delay but they didn't last flight that had a 2 hr delay and I have no faith this one will either if we ever get off the ground that is.

They accepted no responsibility as my connecting flight was not booked through Virgin America, but Virgin Australia. I then had to pay for another ticket to continue my journey back to Australia. The staff member was smug and and would offer no assistance to my predicament. When I arrived at LAX, Virgin America had then lost my luggage. After waiting around I finally hurried a lost luggage report that took so long I was in jeopardy of missing my newly booked flight. I had to argue with the attendant as he would not accept the fact that my phone number was an overseas number. He was adamant that I needed to provide an American phone number(?), which of course I could not provide, as I live in Australia. We agreed on my email address. After arriving back in Australia I did receive an email saying that they had found my luggage and it was ready to be picked up.I replied that this was impossible and how was I to get the luggage and would it be couriered to my house. Their reply was that it was \"a courtesy\" that they would place it on a plane back to Australia, giving me a ticket and flight number. ",

So they had rebooked me on a JetBlue nonstop arriving earlier than my scheduled flight! The level of foresight was excellent, I hadn't even learned of the delay issue before they fixed it. And I got an exit row to boot. So my new favorite airline, Virgin America, is one I've still never flown! (Contrast this with my flight out to Vegas on American Airlines, which refused to let me fly standby to avoid a delayed flight, despite having plenty of open seats, because I didn't have 'status'.

You would think that making seat assignments is such a small task in the airline business, but when you deal with Virgin America, they will leave you convinced that this is a very hard thing to do! First of all, when I booked my flights, their system didn't allow me to make seat assignments because \"it was too early\". I tried again one week before my flight but almost all of their seats were grayed out. I called them to make the seat assignments and waited about 20 minutes to talk to a rep. While waiting, the recorded message cautioned me that I am going to have to pay $20 for using the phone service. Then the rep verbally assigned me seats that were never reflected on their website. I called again to confirm and they said \"it takes time for the seats to show\". I went to the airport to find that those seats are not mine and was given seats in the very last row next to the bathrooms! On the way back, similar screw up has unfolded. Called to make my seat assignments and found myself going through the same hassle. The rep lacked integrity and kept changing his story to force me accept seats in the last row again.

Movies were super expensive but these are just minor gripes. On the way back we were flying to Boston with a stop in San Francisco. Our flight to SFO was delayed so we would be arriving at around 11 with our second flight taking off at 11:10. Everyone was very stressed and Virgin America did not provide much info. We took off about a half an hour later then expected and when we finally arrived at San Francisco, we were stuck at the tarmac for 20 mins. That is obviously not their fault but the staff barely provided any details and they only told us that our plane was waiting, neglecting to tell us what gate it was, and later on, when it left. They clearly didn't want to have to deal with the angry 12 people on the plane who wouldn't by getting to Boston.",

The flight crew was very friendly and captain was communicative throughout. The Red entertainment system is usually great, but mine malfunctioned about 1 hour into the flight. The crew attempted to reset the system but it continued to malfunction. I was offered a seat change, but declined since it would have been a middle seat instead of my aisle. The lead crewmember cancelled my Red charges and upon landing, Virgin sent an email with Travel Bank for an upgrade on my next flight. I spoke with customer service about changing my seat on another flight and it was very easy to move. It is always so nice to talk to a friendly person on the phone who is equipped to solve problems.",

However, VA had lots of space for my legs and seats felt like being made for my size. It felt very comfortable. Even the headrest was high enough (which did not happen to me yet and I am a frequent flyer). Neither Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and others had this comfort. The entertainment system offered everything you wanted. Movies, music, games, food and drink orders. In general, the plane seemed very modern. When ordering a gin tonic (the 50ml gin bottle was told to cost 8$, which is a regular price for short haul flights) they offered me 2 for 1 bottles. Soda was free. As I bought my ticket via Skypicker and had a connection flight, I cannot tell how much the single flight was which makes it difficult to state anything about value for money. Ground service was very solid and friendly, no complaints. Cabin staff could have been a little bit more friendly. When I was asking for an emergency exit seat (one emergency exit row was kept empty as any passenger could upgrade their seat for $150, which I think is a lot, especially having that great seat comfort, which I did not know at that time), the cabin staff was not overly friendly, however, they have not been rude at any time. Altogether, I would absolutely recommend Virgin America, at least when they are using the plane I was flying in. Thank you Virgin America for this experience!",

The seat back monitors allowed you to order drinks right then and there. The drinks are free, and although the food is not, the prices are very reasonable.

The ground crew were nice and the check-in was smooth and fast.  The only remotely negative things about Virgin America are that the remotes are a bit challenging to use (just me being picky) and that it is more expensive than most airlines for a transcontinental, domestic flight.

I learned that if a first leg of a flight was not attended and no cancellation was issued within two hours the entire flight is cancelled with no notification being sent. As a result I was now stranded at JFK with no ticket. When calling the help line I learned they do not offer customer assistance on the weekend and I would be forced to buy a new flight. My original flight was full and a new one way flight home was going to cost over 800, almost 3x the original round trip ticket and there would be no comp of my original ticket value that was never used. The flight assistant provided no real options and pretty much told me good luck. Also, there would be a $50 booking fee since it was the weekend. Terrible experience and insane policy.

The leg room is plentiful and seats are comfortable; I'm 6'4\" and didn't feel cramped at all. JetBlue, Virgin America and Turkish are the only 3 airlines where I fit comfortably in economy class. There are also power outlets at each seat. Every seat has its own TV screen with plenty of free and paid media options. You can order food and drinks through the TV, a very slick system and much preferable to the old call button approach. Soft drinks are free, but all food must be paid for. However it's reasonable. I paid $13 for a small bottle of champagne and a generous cheese, meat and veggie platter. The staff is very friendly and the cabin has trendy purple and blue mood lighting, modern music and an \"interesting\" safety music video en lieu of the typical demonstration. It's a fun approach to the staid airline protocol we're used to. Overall I was very impressed and would pay a bit more to fly Virgin America when possible.",

Boarding went quickly too, and when we got on the plane, the cabin was lit up in deep purples and blues. I found that the entertainment was not quite as impressive as JetBlue's, but it was still good. The food selection could also have more variety. But those were not big problems, because the Gulfstream shortens the flight by an hour and were in Boston in 5.5 hours. Virgin only has one gate at Logan and it is located near baggage claim, which was nice because it was 11.30pm. Overall, my first flight on Virgin America was a success.",

Cabin crews courteous and efficient both ways though a big letdown was when I couldn't charge either my iPod or iPad in an e-mail I received from VX Customer Relations they stated that too many devices charging at the same time results in a drain to the onboard power it is something they're working on and I received compensation for that inconvenience.

On this flight the seat was broken the food terrible and cabin service questionable. The plane interior is a bit tattered and worn from wear (ie soiled).

I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess. Value for money on Virgin America on this trip was great and if you have checked baggage do the upgrade-it's well worth it.",

When I asked the steward about the headsets she was annoyed that I didn't purchase on the computer screen. I really didn't want to wait another hour and she basically threw them at me and said to pay for them when I got a chance. On my flight home March 9 2015 as I was boarding the steward told the boarding agent that there was no more room for luggage in overhead bins. I was not happy about giving up my bag as I had things in there that should not go in a checked bag. She was insistent.

There was some shenanigans on board with two parties who kept wanting to switch seats and the flight attendants handled it with humor and ease. I had a short flight under three hours so the complimentary entertainment options on RED were plenty for me. Also when I went to the restroom the flight attendant opened the door for me. When I went in it was quite large well lit and played spa music. Also when washing my hands the faucet actually stayed on long enough for me to wash my hands instead of me having to keep depressing it. Again a small thing but it's this list of small things about Virgin that have made me a loyal customer. I paid $49 for my trip from DC to Dallas. For $49 I got: excellent service comfortable economy seating and free entertainment. If I have to list one negative I'd say it's the fact that the remote control for the entertainment system is a bit challenging to use.",
